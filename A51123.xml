            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Friendly Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT hath been a weighty Concern upon me, for ſeveral Years, to give forth in Writing a Teſtimony againſt the Spirit of Antichriſt, as I have (through the Love and Mercy of God) been made ſenſible thereof, by the Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of the Living God; and ſo having cleared and eaſed my Mind and Conſcience of what hath lain upon me, I commit to thee the following Treatiſe; deſiring that the fear and dread of the Lord God, may conſtantly have a place in thy Heart in the Reading of it, as it had in mine in the Writing of it, and that will preſerve thee Meek and Low in Heart, in an aptneſs to Learn of Chriſt, the Son of God's Love, that many Profeſſors of Chriſtianity are but ignorantly talking of; and
<pb facs="tcp:61899:3"/>ſo thou wilt not be apt to take offence, nor ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Truth, as thou art made ſenſible of it in thy Heart; but wilt be willing (for thine own Eternal Good) truly to examine thy ſelf before the Lord in Secret, how thou ſtandeſt in thy Spiritual State and Condition before his All-ſeeing Eye; for there was never more need for People to be truly concerned for the Salvation of their Precious Souls than there is now; but they who walk not in the fear of the Lord, ſlight it.</p>
            <p>And if thou Reaſon, ſaying, Ah! But I am Unlearned, and how ſhould I underſtand, or know the Truth? For there are many great Scholars, and Men Learned in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and yet one ſort of them preacheth one Doctrine, and others other Doctrines, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ſhould I know which is the Truth? I anſwer, that thou mayeſt be as capable to know the Truth, as if thou underſtood Latin, and Greek, and Hebrew; for the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Truth in thy own Heart, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth for Sin, is ſufficient to teach thee to know the Truth, if thou believeſt in it, and be truly willing to obey it; and in diſobedience to it, none can know the Truth to their Comfort, though they may perfectly underſtand Latin, Greek and Hebrew, the underſtanding whereof in its place may be good and ſerviceable: Yet thou knoweſt not how ſoon, thou muſt give an
<pb facs="tcp:61899:3"/>Account to the God of Truth, how thou haſt profited with the Manifeſtation of his Spirit of Truth, which is given to thee to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>As for the Times, and Manner, of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſetting up, and eſtabliſhing of the Popiſh Maſs, Ceremonies, Tythes, and other Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, I refer thee to a Book put forth by <hi>Francis Howgill,</hi> in Two Parts, the firſt Intituled, <hi>The Glory of the True Church diſcovered;</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part, <hi>The Rock of Ages exalted above</hi> Rome<hi>'s imagined Rock:</hi> And alſo to a little Book, called, <hi>Popery Arraigned,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>E. H.</hi> it not being my preſent Concern, ſo much, to ſhew the Times, and Perſons, and Manner, how, by whom, and when the Popiſh Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons came up in the Apoſtacy, (that being upon Record, and ſufficiently done before) as to ſhew how much they are contrary to the Scriptures of Truth, and to the Spirit of Truth, by which thoſe Scriptures were given forth; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, profeſſing Chriſtianity and Reformation from Popery, are yet found in them, and in an Antichriſtian Spirit, and how they may know the evil thereof, and come out of them, that they may enjoy the pure Life of Chriſtianity, which is more than Profeſſion thereof.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61899:4"/>
            <p>Herein ſeveral Popiſh Inventions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are very little, or none Treated of, yet comprehended; being contrary to the Scriptures of Truth; and the Witneſs of God in every Heart, in them who truly take heed to it, will Teſtifie againſt them; ſuch as their Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, and Pictures, and Relicks, and Bones of the Dead, and praying to the Dead, and for the Dead, and counting their Prayers by Beads, as if they thought, like the Heathens, (of which Chirſt ſpake) that they ſhould be heard for their much ſpeaking or babling; with their Mattens, and Letanies, and their Idle Complements, and giving of Flattering Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo their being divided into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinct and different Orders and Sorts of Monks, Friars, and Jeſuits, and yet they plead, or cry up Unity; and alſo their Orders for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> Praying wilfully in an Unknown Tongue, and their not permitting to the People the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth in their own Language, which were publick amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians, who ſearched them daily, and found great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by them; and the Apoſtles, and Holy Men of God wrote in a Known Tongue, or Mother Tongue, to whom they wrote, that all might underſtand them, and be edified by them in the Spirit of Chriſt, by which only, the Scriptures of Truth may be truly underſtood: And ſo I commit thee to the Word of God's Grace (which

               <p>The great Enemy of Mankind had then ſo far prevailed upon the Learned Rabbies and Doctors among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that (though they had the Scriptures which teſtified of him in their own Language, yet being erred from the light of his Spirit in themſelves) they were ſo far from receiving Chriſt, and believing in him, that they agreed, that if <hi>any man did confeſs that he was Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue,</hi> John 9.22.

               <p>Yet the ſubtil Deceiver, the Devil (who was a Lyar and a Murtherer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) by his deceitful Devices, and dark Power, prevailed upon many that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the true Light (that enlightens every Man that cometh into the World) and that believed concerning Chriſt, that he laid down his Life for Mankind, and roſe again from the Dead, and aſcended up on high, and ſo they could make a Profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, having a Notional Knowledge of Chriſt, and of things relating to Eternity; and it was by drawing their Minds from the Light of Chriſt in themſelves, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Enemy prevailed to keep them only in a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and in a Form of Godlineſs, but out of the obedience of the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo out of the Truth, though profeſſing it.

               <p>And ſo they were held in Bondage to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Corruptible Things; and tho' they then profeſſed Chriſtianity, and deſired (no doubt) to be called Chriſtians, yet their Enemy beguiling them, and keeping them by his deceit in diſobedience to the Light of Chriſt in themſelves, they acted and lived contrary to true Chriſtianity: And though they appeared as for Chriſt, they were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him and his Truth; and being themſelves deceived, they endeavoured to deceive others, being Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, to which he had nailed the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.18.

               <p>And as the Miniſters of Chriſt declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the true Chriſtians, that the Spirit of Antichriſt ſhould come; ſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his time reſtified,<note place="margin">1 John 4.3.</note> that it was then alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the World: And although it appeared (in them upon whom it prevailed) as for Chriſt, or on his behalf; yet it was (and ſtill is) really againſt him, and the Truth of his Goſpel; being the ſame deceitful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that draws into, and endeavours to keep the Minds of Mankind in the love of outward things, and in a kind of ſatisfaction in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61899:10"/>Performances, old Ceremonies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Traditions and beggarly Elements, and ſo keeps out of the obedience of the Light and Spirit of God, and out of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God which they profeſs; but it keeps in the Service of him who is their Enemy, the Devil who hath deceived them, who is to be caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, to be tormented Day and Night for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10.</p>
               <p>So when Man's grand Enemy could not hinder the glad-tydings of the Goſpel of God's Salvation from being Preached tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Nations of the World, then (by his Spirit of Antichriſt) he laboured with all his ſubtil Devices to keep them who were convinced of the Light of the Goſpel of Chriſt, only in a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, without the Life and Power of Godlineſs, that ſo, though they profeſt Chriſt in words,<note place="margin">Titus 1.16.</note> yet in works they might deny him.</p>

               <p>And many (having itching Ears) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch Teachers, and their pernicious ways, erring from the way of Truth, the

               <p>But their Folly was manifeſted by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, and they that walked in the Light ſaw their Folly.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle called ſuch Antichriſts, ſaying, <hi>Little Children, it is the laſt time: And as ye have heard that Antichriſt ſhall come, even now are there many Antichriſts,</hi>

But they that are unfaithful, and diſobedient to it, them it reproveth and condemneth in their Hearts, and ſuch hate it, and love rather to bear the words of Men (though falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) than to hear the voice of the Light, the word of God's Grace in their Hearts, that reproveth them for Sin, and is the true Teacher that leadeth to Salvation from Sin; and from the Devil, the Author of Sin, the deceitful Enemy of Mankind.</p>
               <p>So the deceitful Antichriſtian Miniſters hating the Light of Chriſt, were unlike to ſpeak well of it, and more unlike to poſſeſs others with the love of it, or to turn their Minds to it, for they loved Darkneſs rather than the Light, and endeavoured to keep their Followers in Darkneſs, leſt they ſhould turn from them.</p>
               <p>But the true Chriſtian Miniſters they lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Light, believed in it, walked in it,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61899:13"/>and in the love and authority of it, they preached it, and ſaid,<note place="margin">1 John 1.5, 6, 7.</note> That the preaching of the Light was the Meſſage which they had heard of God, and declared unto People, and they turned the Minds of many to it, who in the love of it, received it, believed in it, became Children of it, walked in it, had Fellowſhip one with another in it, and knew a cleanſing from all Sin by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Author of their Faith in it.</p>
               <p>Mark the difference between the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and the Antichriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and all that deſire the Salvation of their Souls, ought to beware what they hear, and whom they follow.</p>
               <p>And the difference between the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Miniſters of Antichriſt, is yet more fully declared of by the Scriptures of Truth, for the true Chriſtian Miniſters preached, that all ſhould believe in the Name of Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.13. Heb. 4.12.</note> whoſe Name is called the Word of God, which Word they ſaid was quick, and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing to the dividing aſunder of the Soul, and Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow; and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts, and Intents of the Hearts: And they preached, that this Word ought to be believed in, <hi>which was nigh, even in the mouth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.8. 1 Pet. 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the heart,</hi> being the word of Faith which they preached: By which Word (which liveth and abideth for ever) the true Chriſtians were Born again, and ſo were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61899:14"/>the Children of God, and Heirs of Eternal Life through Chriſt Jeſus, who is called the Word,<note place="margin">John 1.1, 2, 4, 9.12, 13.</note> which was in the beginning with God, and was (and is) God, in whom was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men, that was the true Light which enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth every Man (and Woman) that cometh into the World: And they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as many as received him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his Name, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, which were Born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh,<note place="margin">John 12.36. John 1.5. Rev. 21.24.</note> nor of the will of Man, but of God; and ſo they were Children of the Light by believing in it, and Children of God who is Light, in which Light the Nations of them which are ſaved muſt walk.</p>
               <p>And the true Chriſtian Miniſters preached, that this Light,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7. Jam. 1.21.</note> or Word, or Manifeſtation of the Spirit (which is given to every Man to profit withal) was the engraffed Word, which is able to ſave the Soul; and they called it the Word of God's Grace, (which brings Salvation, and) which is able to build up,<note place="margin">Iſa. 20.32.</note> and to give an Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified;<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.12.</note> and they ſaid, that this Grace of God hath appeared to all Men, teaching (them who obeyed it) to live godly, righteouſly, and ſoberly; and to deny Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts; and thus all the true Chriſtians (as Chriſt ſaid) were to be taught of God;<note place="margin">John 6.45.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61899:14"/>Grace: And they ſaid, as Sin had reigned unto Death, ſo Grace might reign through Righteouſneſs to Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>And ſo the true Chriſtians could ſay, the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, had made them free from the Law of Sin and Death,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.32, 33</note> which Law (according to the Promiſe of God, in his Covenant of Light, and Grace) was put into their Minds, and written in their Hearts, ſo that they ſhould not need to teach every Man his Neighbour, and his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.10.11.</note> for all ſhould know him, from the leaſt even to the greateſt: And they preached, that what was ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joel 2.28. Acts 2.16.17 Rom. 8.14. Rom. 8.9. Cor. 3.16.17. Gal. 5.5, 25.</note> was fulfilled; which God ſaid, That he would pour out of his Spirit upon all Fleſh; and they ſaid, As many as are led of the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: And if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> he is none of his; and ſo conſequently is no true Chriſtian; for the Spirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in true Chriſtians; who through the Spirit wait for the hope of Righteouſneſs by Faith: And as they lived in the Spirit, ſo they exhorted to walk in the Spirit, ſaying, <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit:</hi> And <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle of Chriſt, often exhorteth him that hath an Ear to hear what the Spirit ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7, 11, 17, 29. — and 3.6, 13, 22.</p>
               <p>And by the preaching of the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, many came to receive the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61899:15"/>Teachings of the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghoſt, which is the ſame) and were led by it,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16. Iſa. 54.13, 14. Jer. 31.32.33 John 6.45. Heb. 8.10.11.</note> and ſo became Children of God: And it was truly ſaid among them, the Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; and ſo they were all taught of God, as it was Propheſied of them.</p>
               <p>They were taught of God by his Grace, Light, Spirit, or Word, being one and the ſame, though called by ſeveral other Names, and Appellations (beſides what is before here written) according to the moſt ſuitable Expreſſions, whereby to ſhew the Operations, and Effects of it to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and Capacities of all: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> likewiſe calleth it the Unction,<note place="margin">Joh. 2.20.27</note> or Anointing; writing thus, Ye have an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Holy One, and ye know all things; and again, the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame anointing, teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no Lie; and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him: This (and much more to the ſame purpoſe) was the Doctrine of the true Chriſtian Miniſters, as the Scriptures of Truth more at large declare; and the true Miniſters of Chriſt preach the ſame in our Age and Generation.</p>
               <p>And as the true Miniſters of Chriſt, in his Authority preached his Divine Word, Light, Grace, and Spirit; ſo by the ſame
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61899:15"/>they preached up the Liberty of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and true Chriſtian Diſpenſation; and preached down the uſe of the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law (though formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, and given by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Servant) which was then to ceaſe, being aboliſhed by the Death of Chriſt; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in their time) for Shadows, and Types of good things to come by Chriſt; but he the Subſtance being come, having (as they truly preached) nailed them to his Croſs, and taken them out of the way, they were not then to be uſed by them who had received the free, and glorious liberty of his ſubſtantial Everlaſting Goſpel, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual Diſpenſation of his Word, Light, Grace, and Spirit in their Hearts, and Souls; whereby they knew the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liberty of the free-born Children of God; they were not then to be ſubject to Ordinances, neither burthened with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, nor to obſerve Days, and Times; as may at large be read in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, particularly in theſe places, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, to 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, to 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, to 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11, 12.</p>
               <p>But the deceitful Antichriſtian Miniſters, could not bring any into the True Faith, which is in the Name, Light; Grace, and Spirit of Chriſt, for they were out of it themſelves, and were not faithful, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the Light, and hated it, and would not bring their own Deeds thereto,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61899:16"/>leſt they ſhould be reproved thereby: For though they might talk, and preach of the Name, Word, Grace, Light, or Spirit of Chriſt, and ſpeak there of great ſwelling words, to allure, and draw others after them; yet all that was but in diſobedience to Chriſt, and in deceit, and therefore they could not (by ſuch Preaching) bring any into the true Faith of Chriſt, who is the Truth, nor bring any to believe in his Light, and Grace which they hated, and did deſpite unto.</p>
               <p>And the true Miniſters preached, that true Chriſtians had put off the old Man with his deeds,<note place="margin">Col. 3.9, 10, 11</note> and had put on the new Man, which is renewed in Knowledge after the Image of him that Created him, where there is neither <hi>Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Jew,</hi> Circumciſion, nor Uncircumciſion, <hi>Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> Bond, nor free, but Chriſt is all, and in all; and they preached up a Spiritual Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaying, That he is not a <hi>Jew</hi> which is one outwardly,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28, 29.</note> neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the Fleſh; but he is a <hi>Jew</hi> which is one inwardly, and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is that of the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter; whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God: And again, ſaying to ſome, Ye are Circumciſed with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made without Hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, being buried with him in Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Col. 2.11, 12. <hi>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61899:16"/>of God. And it is plain, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here meant no outward Ordinance of Circumciſion, nor of Baptiſm, for he writes after in the ſame Chapter thus, If ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the World, are ye ſubject to Ordinances (or burdened with Traditions, as ſome Tranſlate it) touch not, taſte not, handle not, which all are to periſh with the uſing, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and Doctrines of Men: Which things have indeed a ſhew of Wiſdom, in Will-worſhip and Humility, and neglecting of the Body, not in any Honour to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Fleſh; concerning which things he warned them, leſt any Man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile them, or ſpoil them through Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or vain Deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt: Read the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame Apoſtle ſaid,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.3.</note> We are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the Fleſh; which ſheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were <hi>Jews</hi> inwardly, and of the inward Circumciſion (as all true Chriſtians are). And this agreeth with the Doctrine of Chriſt himſelf, who ſaid to the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Ye Worſhip ye know not what, we know what we Worſhip, for Salvation is of the</hi> Jews:<note place="margin">John 4.22, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit, and in Truth; for the Father ſeekethſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61899:17"/>him; God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit, and in Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Worſhip of the true Chriſtians was in Spirit, and in the Truth, and in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Spirit of Truth, and not in outward Ordinances, Obſervations of Times, Will-worſhip, nor in Acts of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Humility; and accordingly in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit, the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Miniſters preached; and not in the words that Man's Wiſdom teacheth, but which the ſame Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghoſt) teacheth; which preaching is fooliſhneſs to the natural Man,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.13, 14.</note> for he receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that yields obedience to the Light, or Manifeſtation of the Spirit, (which is given to every Man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) he cometh to diſcern his own Eſtate, and Condition, upon a Spiritual Account; and as he faithfully followeth the Leadings of it, he cometh to know a profiting by it, and in it, and (as he perſevereth in the Love,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9, 10.</note> and Obedience of it) it manifeſteth and revealeth inwardly unto ſuch a one, the Things which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man; which God hath prepared for them that Love him.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preached,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> not with enticing words of Man's Wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and, ſaid he, Chriſt ſent me, not to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61899:17"/>Baptize, but to preach the Goſpel,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17.</note> not with Wiſdom of Words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect:<note place="margin">Gal. 1.11. <hi>to</hi> 17.</note> So he was a Miniſter ſent of Chriſt by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by his Spiritual Appearance in him, and to him, for otherwiſe he was a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Chriſtians, after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And all that are true Miniſters of Chriſt, are ſent, and taught, and moved by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11. <hi>to</hi> 15.</note> for no Man can know the Things of God, but by his Spirit: And if any falſly profeſs to be ſent by his Spirit, their Deceit will be manifeſted by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, to them who walk in it; but as for ſuch as pretend to be Miniſters of Chriſt, who ſay, Divine Revelation is now ceaſed, and mock at the Teachings,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19, 20, 21. Iſa. 54.13, 14. John 6.45.</note> Leadings, and Movings of the Spirit of God, by which all that ever were Children of God were led, and taught, and moved, as is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the Scriptures of Truth, which they falſly profeſs to be their Rule; the Deceit, Hypocriſie, and Wickedneſs of ſuch, is manifeſt to the view of all who have not wilfully ſhut their Eyes.</p>
               <p>And ſo though Antichriſtians may talk, or preach of the Worſhip of God, and may uſe Scripture words, and the words which Chriſt, and his Prophets, and Miniſters ſpeak, which are Recorded in the Scriptures; yet they being erred from his Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in only the true Worſhip of God is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they are out of the true Worſhip of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61899:18"/>God, and Worſhip they know not what; for their Worſhip is in the Spirit of Errour, and not in the Spirit of Truth; and all the Preaching of ſuch, with all their Learning, acquired Parts, and Philoſophy, it is but vain Deceit, and ſtands in the Wiſdom that is from below,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.15.</note> which is earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh; and ſo thoſe are moved by the Spirit of the Devil, who mock at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the Spirit of God, let their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be what it will.</p>
               <p>So the Scriptures ſhew plainly, that there was Antichriſts, or Antichriſtian Miniſters, in the Apoſtles Time, and that there was a great difference between them and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or true Miniſters of Chriſt; and the Followers of thoſe falſe flattering Deceivers, were (as their Leaders were) principally deceived, by giving heed to the Inſinuations of the Old Serpent, their deceitful Enemy, in their own Particulars.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that loved, and obeyed the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in their own Hearts, and Conſciences, they came to a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their own Eſtates, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions inwardly; and alſo came thereby into a true diſcerning of the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Miniſters of Chriſt, who were in, and by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, Commiſſionated to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Truth; and thoſe who without Commiſſion from Chriſt (and in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Light and Spirit) preached for their own Carnal Ends and Deſigns; ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61899:18"/>could diſcern between the Voice of Chriſt in his true Miniſters,<note place="margin">John 10.4, 5.</note> and a ſtrange Voice in them that falſly pretended ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Such could diſcern between thoſe who preached for filthy Lucre, love of Money, or any other ſelf-end; and thoſe whom the Love of Chriſt conſtrained to Preach;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Love (which they want who hate his Light) all Preaching (though with never ſo much Excellency of words) is but as ſounding Braſs,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.1, 2, 3.</note> or a tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal; and without which, the moſt ſeeming excellent Works of Piety, are nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable.</p>
               <p>Such could diſcern (in, and by the Light, and Spirit of Chriſt, which ſearcheth all things, to which they were obedient) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that were of God, whom true Chriſtians heard,<note place="margin">1 John 4.6.</note> and them that were of the World, whom the World heard; and thereby they knew the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Errour. And ſuch by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt (in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge) came truly to diſcern the deceitful Devices,<note place="margin">Col. 2.3. 2 Cor. 2.11.</note> and Snares of their Souls great Enemy, who in his Deviliſh Wiſdom, and Serpentine Subtilty, was continually endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle, and deceive them (as he did others) both inwardly, by his dark, unclean, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power; and outwardly by the Deceit of the ſame Power, and Spirit in his deceived, deceitful Antichriſtian Miniſters, who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelves as into the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.13, 14 15.</note> or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61899:19"/>Miniſters of Chriſt; but the true Chriſtians diſcerned them, and knew that their end ſhould be according to their Works; and they likewiſe knew that Satan himſelf was transformed into an Angel of Light.</p>
               <p>And yet in and by the true Light of Chriſt (which enlighteneth every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World) they ſaw him to be what he is, to wit, a Serpent, a Dragon, a roaring Lion, the Devil, an Adverſary, a Murderer, a Devourer, a wicked Spirit; and by many other Names, and ſuitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, is he called by the Scriptures of Truth, to deſcribe the Viſage of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One, that all may in the Light of Chriſt behold his Deceitfulneſs, wherewith he is continually endeavouring to Deſtroy, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Devour the Souls of the Children of Men, both by his Transformed Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And all that profeſs Chriſtianity, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Light, and Spirit of Chriſt, they may fitly be ſaid to be Transformed, or to Transform themſelves, whether Leaders or Followers of others; for they are neither Members of Chriſt, Children of the Light, nor Children of God, who is Light, as all true Chriſtians are; and therefore ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Transform themſelves into Chriſtians; that is, they pretend to be Chriſtians falſly.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as are not Children of the Light, nor Children of God, whoſe Children are they? Are not they Children of Darkneſs, and Diſobedience, and of the Power of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61899:19"/>Darkneſs, which is the Devil? Such are groſly deceived, and transformed, as were thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who profeſſed to be both the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of God, and yet Chriſt ſaid plainly unto them,<note place="margin">John 8.33, <hi>to</hi> 45.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And all People, in and by the Light and Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Chriſt, may examine, and try themſelves, whether they be true Chriſtians, (who are Children of God) yea, or nay: For the Spirit of Chriſt beareth witneſs, with true Chriſtians,<note place="margin">

Surely theſe things are of great importance, and are worthy to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and weightily conſidered of by all People, who deſire the Salvation of their precious Souls; and they who have truly believed in the Light of Chriſt, and yielded obedience thereunto, have therein, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeen, and weightily conſidered theſe things, and have learned, and are learning, to avoid the Snares of the Devil's deceit of Unrighteouſneſs, wherewith he beguiles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>For true Chriſtians are the Sheep of Chriſt, which hear, and know his Voice, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him;<note place="margin">John 10.3. <hi>to</hi> 14.</note> and a Stranger they will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for they know not the Voice of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but Chriſt is the good Shepherd, who giveth his Life for the Sheep; and ſaid he, I know them, and am known of mine: whereby it is evident, that true Chriſtians have a true diſcerning of the Voice of Chriſt, (which is the Light or Manifeſtation of his Spirit in them) from the Voice of a Stranger, which (ſaith he) they will flee from, whether in themſelves, or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>And ſuch may rightly be called Strangers, who diſobey the Light, Voice, and Spirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.18, 19, 20, 21. Eph. 2.12. Iſa. 42.6.

               <p>And to ſuch Chriſt is a Stranger (though they may profeſs great things in his Name) and in the Sentence of true Judgment, he will ſay unto them (they not being termed his Sheep, but Goats) <hi>I was a Stranger,</hi>

               <p>And ſo they that in their dead Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no overcoming the wicked One on this ſide the Grave, they believe quite contrary to the true Chriſtians, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> teſtified of them to whom he wrote,<note place="margin">1 John 4.4.</note> ſaying, <hi>Ye have overcome the wicked One;</hi> and though he writes,<note place="margin">1 John 1.8, 9, 10.</note> ſaying, <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us:</hi> yet he writes in the next words after, <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs; If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a lyar, and his Word is not in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the ſaid Words (to wit, <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin,</hi> &amp;c.) which ſome greatly object in this caſe, be taken as they are in the common Tranſlations yet that will not import the Apoſtle himſelf to be included; as the Scripture hath ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> ſpeaking of the Tongue, ſaith, <hi>Therewith curſe we Men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 3.9. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us Eat and Drink, for to morrow we dye,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. Who can conclude from hence, that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> was a Curſer
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61899:23"/>of Men? Or that <hi>Paul</hi> was one of thoſe lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious Ones, who uſed that ſaying about Eating and Drinking, which was reproved by the Prophet? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.13. and 56.12. Or who can from the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s Words here, conlude that he then had Sin?

So alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> in this place, after that which ſome tranſlate thus, to wit, <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us</hi> (which might relate to the Conditions of others, though not to his own preſent condition) ſaith in the very next words thus, <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi> Now is not all Sin Unrighteouſneſs? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what can be more plain than that the Apoſtle here declareth that upon Confeſſion and Repentance, true Believers are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven, but alſo come to be cleanſed from Sin? And doth he not alſo in the next Words before thoſe that are objected (as well as after) fully declare the ſame, ſpeaking of the Light (which they that love Sin, do not love) thus, <hi>If we walk in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61899:24"/>Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we have fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And moreover, according to ſaid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tranſlation, if any ſhould think the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> here to be included, yet, he doth not ſay, that we ſin daily in Thought, Word and Deed, nor that the beſt Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of the Children of God are ſinful, or mix'd with Sin; as the pleaders for Sin for term of Life, ſay; therefore what he ſaid, importeth not the matter they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for.</p>
               <p>But according to thoſe Tranſlators (much approved by Proteſtants) <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Paſor,</hi> and others, the aforeſaid objectible Words of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> are to be rendred thus, to wit, <hi>If we have ſaid us not to have Sin</hi> (the Latin words being thus, <hi>ſi dixerimus nos peccatum non habere;</hi> which are according to the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Greek words (in which the Apoſtle wrote) which are theſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) which implieth the time paſt, and that there had been a time wherein they could not have truly ſaid that they had no Sin. See <hi>Beza</hi>'s Latin Teſtament, and <hi>Paſor</hi>'s Lexicon.</p>
               <p>But that all are to continue in Sin while in this World, the Words of the ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here, are very plain to the contrary, to wit, <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful, and juſt to forgive us our Sins,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 John 2.1, to 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin:</hi> And again, <hi>My little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not:</hi> And ſpeaking of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him;</hi> And again ſaith he, <hi>Every one that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure:</hi> And again, <hi>Ye know that he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to take away our Sin, and in him is no Sin, whoſoever abideth in him, ſinneth not: whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, neither known him: Little Children, let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you</hi> (it ſeemeth, there were pleader; for Sin, then) <hi>he that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous, even as he is righteous, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the beginning: For this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil; whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God; in this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which, and many other Scripture ſayings, it is evident that the Faith of thoſe who believe that they cannot be free from ſinning, but muſt carry a Body of Sin, and a Body of Death while they are in this World, is quite contrary to the Faith, and Teſtimony of true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For the Faith of true Chriſtians is in Chriſt, the Power of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.2.</note> and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

               <p>And ſo though thoſe whoſe Faith is dead, being ſervants of Sin, may profeſs Chriſt (who is a quickning Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45. Epheſ. 2.1, 2, to 7.</note> and quickned, and quickneth them that truly believe in him, who were dead in Treſpaſſe and Sins) yet in that dead Faith they cannot enjoy the benefit (which true Chriſtians did,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1, 2.</note> and do enjoy) which is to be ſet free from the Law of Sin and Death, by the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus; for according to their Faith, ſo it is unto them.</p>
               <p>For as the People of Chriſt's own Country were offended at him for his Wiſdom, and his mighty Works, and being aſtoniſhed, ſaid,<note place="margin">Mark 6.1, to 7. Mat. 13.54, to 58.</note>

               <p>For the Holy Scriptures ſay plainly, That as many as received Chriſt, and believed on his Name,<note place="margin">John 1.1, to 14. Rev. 19.13.

               </p>
               <p>And although the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil that I would not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.9, to 25.</note> 
                  <hi>that I do:</hi> Yet it is plain by what he wrote before, and after that, in the ſame Epiſtle, that he wrote not of his own then <hi>preſent condition,</hi> but of himſelf as well as others paſſing thro' that Condition; for in that continued kind of Speech he likewiſe there ſaith, <hi>I am carnal ſold under Sin;</hi> but a little before he had told them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Carnal Mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can be:</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>for they are fool ſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him, neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned.</hi> And in the beginning of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> aforeſaid, he expreſſeth himſelf to be able to impart unto them Spiritual Gifts,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.11.</note> which a Carnal Man could not do.</p>
               <p>By which it is plain, that when he wrote that Epiſtle, he was not Carnal ſold under Sin, neither a Servant of Sin; and therefore he was in another condition than he had been in, of which he wrote the ſaid obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible Words; And that which renders it more plain, is, that in the ſame Epiſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Words,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.16. to 24.</note> he gave teſtimony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom he wrote, <hi>that they were made free from Sin, and become Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Righteouſneſs, and Servants to God:</hi> But they that are carnal, ſold under Sin, are not ſo, for how can they be free from Sin, who remain carnal ſold under Sin?</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle immediately after that kind of Speech, which intimated his former condition, declared plainly that he had (when he wrote that Epiſtle) attained to a better ſtate; for in the concluſion of that kind of ſpeech, he writes thus, <hi>I ſee another Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin which is in my Members; O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> Now for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61899:28"/>what doth he give thanks, if not for Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? for he ſaith preſently after, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> 
                  <hi>hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is plain that he was delivered, and ſet free from the Law of Sin and Death, unto which he had been in Captivity while he was carnal, ſold under Sin; and therefore the aforeſaid Words of <hi>Paul</hi> (with which ſome plead againſt the poſſibility of freedom from Sin) cannot properly be rendred to deſcribe his preſent condition at the writing thereof.</p>
               <p>And it may at large be read in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (as alſo of the other Apoſtles) that Freedom from ſin,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4. to 11. Rom. 6.22 1 Cor. 15.56, 57.</note> and the ſervitude thereof may be, and was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by true Chriſtians while in this World.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that from the aforeſaid Words of <hi>Paul,</hi> do plead for continuance in ſin during Life,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32, 33, 34. Iſa. 22.12, 13, 14.

               </p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (as it were to put the matter concerning the underſtanding of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, out of all queſtion,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.14, 15, 16.</note> writes

               <p>By which it is evident that where the Man of Sin hath prevailed by his deceitful power in and upon any, when ſuch come by the Light of Chriſt (the Word of God's Power) in themſelves, to be convinced of their Sins, and made willing to reſiſt the wicked One in the Faith of Chriſt) the Power of God; yet it ſeemeth not eaſie (at the firſt) for ſuch to believe in the mighty Speakings of Chriſt, the Power of God, in themſelves; nor to believe in Chriſt's Ability to ſave and cleanſe them from all Sin, and that he is able with the Spirit of his Mouth, and the Brightneſs of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to conſume and deſtroy the Man of Sin, and his Works in them.</p>

               <p>Now ſuch who hold that Perfection or Freedom from Sin is not attainable by the Grace of God in this World, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly confeſs that every degree of ſervice done to Satan, is an act of treachery, and diſloyalty againſt the King of Heaven; and every Sin, is certainly ſome degree of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to Satan; therefore ſuch may as well hold, that it is impoſſible while in this World, to do any thing but act treachery and diſloyalty againſt God, the King of Heaven: but certainly Death, is the reward of treachery and diſloyalty, and the Wages of Sin.</p>

               <p>And many call the Popes, or Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Man of Sin, which the Apoſtle ſaid ſhould be revealed, who may (by the Light of Chriſt in their own Hearts) be ſenſible of the Man of Sin, and his power and works in themſelves unto them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; and therefore it were good for ſuch firſt, by the Power of God, to be cleanſed from him, and his power, and works inwardly in themſelves, leſt they become more and more like unto him</p>
               <p>But indeed the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have been the chief viſible Rulers of the falſe Church, drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jeſus,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.5, 6.</note> and the Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and the many Abominations of the Earth; and the Inventers and ſetters up of the peſtilent Traditions, and idolatrous Ceremonies ſtill uſed in the Apoſtaſy from the Truth, and many who look upon themſelves as reformed from Popery, are yet (in a great meaſure) found in many of their pernicious Practices, and Inventions to get Money by.</p>
               <p>For the Popes having been, in a great degree, influenced by the power and ſpirit of the Man of Sin, the Devil; and having had the higheſt outward Exaltation over the Nations, and Kings of the Earth, or

               <p>And amongſt the many Popiſh Cheats, none ſeemeth greater then their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or their telling of a purging Place from Sin after this Life, whereby many are cheated of Eternal Happineſs, by living (in hopes thereof) ſecurely in Sin while they live; and many cheated of their Money alſo, for Pardon and Indulgences from the Pope, to redeem the Souls of their deceaſed Friends out of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Which is contrary to the Truth, and to the Record of the Holy Scriptures, which ſay, where the Tree falleth, there ſhall it be, and <hi>every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the Fire;</hi>

               <p>Now if a good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, how is it then that all good men
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61899:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>are continually ſinning? for Sin is Evil Fruit: And if every ſuch a one as bringeth not forth good Fruit, muſt be caſt into the Fire, and there muſt lie, how can the Pope (or any Man elſe) recover ſuch out of the Fire? And if it be the wide Gate, and broad Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, how can they that walk therein eſcape De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? or the Pope deliver them from it when they come to the end of their Journey?</p>
               <p>But yet this Antichriſtian Doctrine of a Purgatory after this Life, is upheld by the Popes, and by their Cardinals, Biſhops and Councils, to their great gain of Money to themſelves, and their Clergy, ſo called; and upon this groundleſs point of their Faith hangs many of their Antichriſtian Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to get Money by, as their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Maſſes, Diriges, Requiems, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Pardons, Jubilees, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended power of Binding, and Looſing, and their Prayers for the Dead. And though many pretending Reformation from <hi>Popery,</hi> deny their Purgatory and Prayers for the Dead, yet they claim Popiſh Wages for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead, which they call Mortua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and annex it to their Tythes, for which they caſt them, that cannot for Conſcience ſake pay them, into Priſon; and ſo they deny the Work, but claim the Wages, which is more unreaſonable then to work for Wages</p>
               <p>And it is a general Tenet of pretended Reformiſts, that none can be fully cleanſed from Sin on this ſide the Grave, and yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61899:42"/>confeſs they, that no unclean thing ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven; and then where muſt they be cleanſed? or how will they eſcape the Popes Purgatory, which they alſo deny?</p>

               <p>And ſo no Men can communicate any of their Merits towards the ſaving of others (that Pretence being an abominable Cheat to get Money by) for true Chriſtians are what they are by the Grace of God, and the working thereof in their Hearts, and never pretend to any of their own Merits, for their Salvation is only by Chriſt, who bath obtained Eternal Redemption for them, and purchaſed them with his own Blood.</p>

               <p>But how much this Falſe Church, this City <hi>Babylon</hi> hath glorified her ſelf, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved deliciouſly; ſo much Torment and Sorrow muſt be given her, for ſhe ſaith in her Heart, <hi>I ſit a Queen, and am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no Sorrow;</hi> therefore ſhall her Plagues come in one day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and ſhe ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be burned with Fire; for ſtrong is the Lord God, who judgeth her: and the Kings of the Earth who have committed Fornication, and lived deliciouſly with her, ſhall bewail her and lament for her, when they ſhall ſee the Smoke of her Burning, ſtanding afar off for fear of her Torment, ſhall ſay, <hi>Alas! alas! that great City Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, that mighty City; for in one Hour is thy Judgment come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Merchants of the Earth ſhall weep, and mourn over her, for no Man buyeth their Merchandize any more (a great number of Prieſts, and covetous Preachers will be at a great loſs then, and that Day is now drawing near) for fear of her Torment, weeping, and wailing, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61899:45"/>ſaying, <hi>Alas! alas! that great City that was cloathed in fine Linnen, and Purple, and Scarlet, and decked with Gold, and precious Stones, and Pearls, for in one hour, ſo great Riches is come to nought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Heaven, and the holy Apoſtles and Prophets, ſhall then rejoyce over her, when God hath avenged them on her;<note place="margin">Rev. 18.</note> for by her Sorceries were all Nations deceived, and in her is, and will be found the Blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>And if this falſe whoriſh Church had not had a large and ſplendid Profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and Religion, ſhe could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have magnified her ſelf ſo much, nor by her Sorceries could ſhe ſo have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all Nations; and if it had not been a Golden Cup that ſhe handed forth to the Nations, being full of Abomination and Filthineſs of her Fornication, probably ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uld not have allured the Inhabitants of the Earth, ſo freely and generally to have drunk of it, as they have done, with which they have been made drunk, brutiſh and ravenous, ſo that as Wolves they have preyed upon the Sheep of Chriſt, (true Chriſtians, who loved their Enemies and Perſecutors) and in killing of them, they thought they did God good Service (as Chriſt foretold) being drunk with the Wine of the Whore's Fornication.<note place="margin">Joh. 16.2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo they were far from the Nature of Chriſt, and from his Teachings, who came
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61899:45"/>not to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them, and taught (and by his Spirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) all his Diſciples to love their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but they are far from loving their Enemies, who kill, or perſecute their Friends, for witneſſing to the Truth, though it reprove them for Sin; for Sin may cauſe them to be deſtroyed, but it will never do any of them any Good; thus all Perſecutors are acted by the Murthering Spirit of the Man of Sin, and drunk with the Wine of the Whores Cup.</p>
               <p>And ſo as <hi>Cain</hi> (who was the firſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor about Religion) had a Mark ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, leſt any finding him ſhould kill him;) ſo all Perſecutors about Religion have a mark ſet upon them, for their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting is an infallible Mark or Token whereby all may know that their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vain, and that they are no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but falſe Pretenders to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>All that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall ſuffe Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;</hi> and ſo they are no perſecutors, but perſecuted, and can Pray for ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them: And when <hi>Paul</hi> was called <hi>Saul,</hi> he was a Perſecutor, and conſenting to the Death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who prayed for his Perſecutors and Murtherers;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.10.</note> but when he believed in the Light, the Word of Faith in the Heart, and ceaſed to kick againſt the Pricks of it, and obeyed the Teachings of it, then of a Perſecutor he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61899:46"/>became a Preacher of the Croſs of Chriſt, which he bare through much Perſecution, even unto Death,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note> and could ſay, <hi>This light Affliction which is but for a Moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory;</hi> and ſaid he, <hi>I reckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time,</hi>

                  <hi>are not worthy to be compared to the Glory that ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us:</hi> So he changed for a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>And ſo all Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, of what ſort ſoever, that are Perſecutors, are within the compaſs of the falſe Church, Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> in whom is found the Blood of all the Righteous that are ſlain upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>And though ſuch differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, one Preaching this, and another that different Doctrine, and often go to Wars, and kill one another about their pretended Religions, and Doctrines, and Tenets, and which of them can get the upperhand, prey upon, vex, and trouble the others, yet none of them all can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be perſecuted themſelves; but when they are under, they creep into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and hide, or run, or ſeek to ſave themſelves by joining with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Perſecutors in Hypocriſie, and being at difference thus among themſelves (like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi>) yet they can all agree to ſet at naught, and mock, and perſecute Chriſt in his Members.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61899:46"/>
               <p>But true Chriſtians, Children of the Light, are Children of God, and God is their Friend, and therefore they fear not what Man can do unto them, for they know that God their Father will preſerve his faithful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and they are Members of Chriſt, (the Truth) and the Truth is precious in their Eye, and their Faith in it is worth contending for, and worth ſuffering for, and for it they can ſuffer what God their Father ſeeth meet, and Man can inflict no more; and ſo true Chriſtians are freely given up to ſuffer Perſecution for Chriſt, the Lord their Righteouſneſs, knowing it will be to the glory of God, if he ſo pleaſe, and alſo having an Eye to the Recompence of Reward.</p>
               <p>And now is fulfilled that which was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In the Day when the Branch of the Lord ſhall be beautiful and glorious,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 4.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Fruit of the Earth excellent and comely for all them that are eſcaped of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>then ſeven Women ſhall take hold of one man, ſaying, We will eat our own Bread, and wear our own Apparel, only let us be called by thy Name to take away our Reproach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now is the Name of Chriſt, who is called the Branch, become of eſteem with many Nations, and ſo is beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and the Fruit that in many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in deep Sufferings, and otherwiſe, hath been and is brought forth, is excellent and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61899:47"/>comely; and ſo now there are many divided Profeſſions among People, and every Gathering of them, of each ſort, call themſelves by the honourable Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſo they ſeem to take hold of Chriſt, and would be called by his Name, to have their Reproach taken away, for they will eat their own Bread, feed upon their own Imaginations, Carnal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Senſual Wiſdom, and alſo upon their Pleaſures and Vanities, and likewiſe they will wear their own Apparel, have their own Profeſſions, and cover with a Covering, but not of the Spirit of God; (no, for they mock at the Movings of the Spirit, and at the cloathing of the Spirit; but <hi>if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his</hi>) and ſo they know not a feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bread of Life which Chriſt giveth, nor a being cloathed with the fine Linnen, which he giveth to be cloathed withal; but are a Reproach to the Name of Chriſt, and therefore their Reproach is not taken away, they have not the end of their deſire; being out of the Life of true Chriſtianity, they cannot have truly the Name.</p>
               <p>And ſuch, in every of their ragged Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions wherewith they would cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (like <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with Fig-leaves) in each of their Companies, have Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, which call themſelves Divines; and why ſo? becauſe they were brought up at Natural Schools and Colleges, and have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61899:47"/>learned Languages, as <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> (but there have been many more Languages than thoſe ſince the building of <hi>Babel</hi>) and it was <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> which <hi>Pilate</hi> ſet over the Head of Chriſt, when they crucified him;<note place="margin">Luke 23.38.</note> and ſo ſuch ſet <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> over Chriſt in his Spiritual Appearance by his Light, Grace, and the Manifeſtation of his Spirit in their Hearts, where he is crucified afreſh in their Affections and Luſts; and ſo they are more ſenſual than divine. And thoſe their Teachers having paid much for their Learning, they make as rich Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of it as they can, they get as large Benefices or Wages as they can, and no doubt but they ſet forth their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize as gorgeouſly as they can, too; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially till their Benefices or Wages be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed (as they think) upon them; and then vendible, or not vendible, they will have their rate, or with force and with cruelty take it.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the Merchants of the Earth (for their Merchandize is earthly, and bought for Money, which cannot buy Heaven) who are waxen Rich through the abundance of the Delicacies of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with whom they Trade, and at the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which haſteth apace) they will weep and mourn over her,<note place="margin">Rev. 18.3, 11.</note> for no Man will buy their Merchandize any more; for true Chriſtians cannot hire Teachers to deceive
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61899:48"/>People (nor pay to them) who ſtrengthen the Hands of Evil-doers, preaching Peace where there is no Peace.</p>
               <p>And thus theſe Merchants, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Teachers and Prieſts being waxed rich,<note place="margin">Jer. 5.31.</note> like the falſe Prophets and Prieſts of Old, they bear Rule by their Means, and in the power of Darkneſs, the power of the Man of Sin, in the woful Night of Apoſtacy, the Heads of them, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue ruled over the Kings of the Earth, and have declared, pronounced and defined that every Creature upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Salvation, muſt be ſubject to them, the Popes, who ſay, their Doctrine is infallible; but now many know that much of it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And now the Everlaſting Day of God is at hand, in which the Name of the Lord ſhall be great among the <hi>Heathen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal 1.11.</note> from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame, and in the Light of Chriſt, the Son of Righteouſneſs, (which is ariſen, and is ariſing with healing in his Wings, unto many who have feared,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> and do fear the Name of the Lord) many are made ſenſible of the ſame; and know that the Light thereof is driving away the Spiritual Darkneſs (of the woful Night of Apoſtacy) which hath long covered the Earth, and the Hearts of the People, and many ſhall come to ſee plainly the deceit of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61899:48"/>of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is revealed, and is to be yet more and more revealed by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, and they who ſee their deceit plainly (except they be very fooliſh) will buy their Merchandize no more, and then down falls their Trade.</p>
               <p>And now let all (who are convinced of the Popiſh Error in telling of a Purging from Sin after this Life, and yet ſay that there is no freedom from Sin attainable on this ſide the Grave;) conſider that no unclean thing can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.27.</note> and then, where and when muſt their Souls be made clean from Sin, if not while their Bodies live?</p>
               <p>And let all ſuch examine themſelves inwardly in the true Light of Chriſt Jeſus, whether they be not in the Suburbs of the City <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in Confuſion? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they be fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, into which nothing that defileth, or worketh abomination, or maketh a lye, can in anywiſe enter: but they that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, in whoſe Light the Nations of them which are ſaved muſt walk, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23, 24, 27.</p>
               <p>And all thoſe who in any meaſure ſee themſelves to be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion inwardly, as all are who diſobey the Light of Chriſt, and walk not in the Path thereof, but would have Salvation in their own Ways, or Religions, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61899:49"/>they reckon were the Religions of their Forefathers, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of Old, who reckoned themſelves <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, and yet would not believe in Chriſt, whoſe Day <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw, and rejoiced to ſee, whoſe Day the ſaid <hi>Jews</hi> deſpiſed, and ſlighted the Viſitation thereof unto them: Now it is high time for all ſuch to take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed to the Light of Chriſt in their own Hearts, which only can truly give them a true diſcovery inwardly of their ſeveral Eſtates and Conditions in which their Souls ſtand in the ſight of God, who knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts.</p>
               <p>And as they carefully mind and obey this true Light, which ſecretly reproves for Sin in their Hearts and Conſciences,<note place="margin">John 6.2. John 8.12.</note> it will certainly ſhew them whether they work the Works of God, which is to believe on him, or on that which God hath ſent, which is on the Light, which whoſoever followeth, ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life:<note place="margin">Eph. 5.13.</note> Or they work the Works of the Man of Sin, the Works of Darkneſs, which are reproved, and reprovable by the Light; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is reproved or reprovable, is made manifeſt by the Light.</p>
               <p>And ſo all by Examination may prove and try themſelves, whether they be in the true Faith of Chriſt which giveth the Victory, and ſo the Apoſtle adviſed, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto theſe Words, <hi>Know ye not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61899:49"/>your own ſelves</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! it is a dreadful thing to ſell Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs for Earthly Trifles, (and what elſe is all the Glory of the World?) as <hi>Eſau,</hi> being faint, (it ſeems he wanted true Faith) he ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Pottage, and loſt the Bleſſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hunting abroad;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.17.</note> and afterwards could not find a Place of Repentance, tho' he ſought it earneſtly, or carefully, and that with Tears.</p>
               <p>And ſo let all beware, leſt they bring themſelves into <hi>Eſau</hi>'s condition, for they cannot find a Place of Repentance when they have ſinned out their Day, and ſold Heaven for a little Vanity: And let none hunt abroad like <hi>Eſau,</hi> who that while loſt the Bleſſing; but every one at home, may do well to take heed to the Light, though it ſhine but as in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-Star ariſe in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>For it it a terrible thing to neglect the Day of the Viſitation of the Love of God, in and by the Light and Grace of Jeſus Chriſt; (for he would not that any ſhould periſh) as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did, whom he would often have gathered as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, but ſhe would not; wherefore Chriſt wept over her, ſaying, <hi>Oh! that thou hadſt known in this thy Day, the things which concern thy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61899:50"/>Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes;</hi> And then he declared of the Wo, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and Miſery, that was therefore to come upon her, by her Enemies prevailing over her, becauſe ſhe knew not the time of her Viſitation, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, 42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>And ſo Wo, Confuſion and Miſery, will certainly come upon every particular Man or Woman, by the prevailing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their Enemy, the Man of Sin, the Power of Darkneſs, who reject the Light of Chriſt, and rebel againſt it, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Day of their Souls Viſitation by it.</p>
               <p>For the Light of Chriſt, who is the Sun of Righteouſneſs is extended to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to teach People to fear the Name of God, that ſo the Sun of Righteouſneſs may ariſe upon them, and that they may be gathered under the healing Wings thereof, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens; and ſo Chriſt ſtandeth at the Door of Peoples Hearts, and knocketh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.20</note> and entreateth, that they may open unto him, that he may come in unto them, and Sup with them, and they with him.</p>
               <p>But all they who reject his Counſel, and will none of his Reproof, but delight in Vanity, and do not chuſe the Fear of the Lord, who when he knocketh, will not open; when he calleth, will not anſwer;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61899:50"/>and when he ſtretcheth out his Hand,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be gathered; theſe may ſeek him, but ſhall not find him; theſe may call, but he will not anſwer; theſe may cry, but he will not hear them.</p>
               <p>And it is not Profeſſion only that will ſtand any inſtead (though it be of the very Truth it ſelf) without Faithfulneſs to God, in the Great and Terrible Day of the Lord which is at hand,<note place="margin">Zeph. 1.12.</note> wherein the will Plead with all Fleſh, and ſtain the Glory thereof; wherein he will ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Candles, and puniſh the Men that are ſettled on their Lees; for the Lord, by his Light, ſearcheth the Heart, and tryeth the Reins,<note place="margin">Jer. 17.10.</note> even to give to every Man according to his Ways, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fruit of his Doings.</p>
               <p>And now God requireth all People to hear his beloved Son, who ſpeaks from Heaven by his Light in their Hearts, his Heavenly Voice, which Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaith, <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>my People,</hi>

               <p>And they who call themſelves <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> (what ſort ſoever they be of) who proteſt againſt the Abominations of the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they come not to the Light, nor bring their Deeds to it, that their Deeds may be made manifeſt by it that they are wrought in God, they are yet but in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in Confuſion, and in Darkneſs, and there they are in the inventing Nature, in which <hi>Popery</hi> firſt aroſe, and from which ſprung their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Ordinances to get Money by; and ſo they are far from the Nature of them who firſt began to proteſt againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> who according to what was made manifeſt, anſwered the Light in their Hearts, and were wonderfully preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>And ſo they who profeſs Chriſtianity, and are erred from the Light of Chriſt in their own Hearts, and live in Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, they are walking in the Way of the Man of Sin, who is their Leader and Ruler; And what need ſuch to call the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Babylon? or the Pope, (who is called the Head of it) Antichriſt, or the Man of Sin, who are in Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſubject to the Spirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in themſelves?</p>

               </p>
               <p>In which Words the ſaid <hi>Robert Perſons</hi> writes as if the Man of Sin, or Antichriſt, were not yet revealed, or not yet come to his Exaltation, but the ſaid (Apoſtle) <hi>John,</hi> whom he quotes, teſtified.

               <p>And this appeareth by the Decrees of their own Councils, which tend to enjoin
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61899:52"/>all to conform, or burn; an Antichriſtian Decree indeed; and wo will be the portion of them who make ſuch Unrighteous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and preſcribe ſuch grievous things: what will they do in the Day of Viſitation? and in the Deſolation which ſhall come from far? to whom will they flye for Help, and where will they leave their Glory? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And if any be offended at what is here written, let ſuch know, that he that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this, hath no evil will or prejudice in his Heart towards any Man, or any People in the World, but deſireth the good of all, even as he deſireth the ſame for himſelf, and (according to the Mind of Chriſt) would not that any ſhould periſh, but that all through true Repentance, might find Mercy, and obtain Eternal Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For I have (by woful Experience) known a time when the deceivable unrighteous power of the Devil, the Man of Sin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon me ſo far, that I could not then believe, that ever I could be free from Sin while in this World, becauſe I daily felt my ſelf overcome by, and ſubject to Sin, which daily deceived me; and ſo I was perſwaded of the common received Tenet, <hi>viz.</hi> No freedom from Sin whilſt in this World, but that all muſt carry a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61899:53"/>Body of Sin, and a Body of Death whilſt on this ſide the Grave.</p>
               <p>And ſo was I long in a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, being often troubled exceedingly in my Heart and Conſcience, with a deep ſence of my own ſinful condition, which in and by the true Light of Chriſt Jeſus in my Heart and Conſcience, I plainly ſaw to be very wicked and deplorable, wherewith my Soul was grievouſly oppreſſed, but knew not how to be eaſed of my Burden, which ſeemed to me ſuch an intolerable heavy Burden or Load, that I was very near to have fainted under it; for the more I looked into my inward condition, the worſe it then ſeemed unto me, being exceedingly afraid leſt the Lord ſhould have cut me off in mine Iniquity wherewith I had provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him.</p>
               <p>And the ſence of this my Condition, kept me in a conſtant Care leſt I ſhould do any thing whatſoever that might further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe or provoke the Lord God of Heaven and Earth againſt me, and ſo make my Load more grievous; and as I thus looked upon my Soul to be in a moſt wretched forlorn condition, and in continual danger to be caſt into everlaſting Fire (in which the Devil and his Angels are tormented Day and Night for ever, and ever) then for a long ſeaſon I cryed in bitterneſs of Soul unto the Lord, that I believed knew
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61899:53"/>the very ſeeret Thoughts and Intents of all Hearts, that he would ſhew Mercy unto me, and teach me to know the Way wherein he would have me to walk; for I was yet as a Stranger to, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that which then, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, reproved me for Sin in my Heart, which is the Light of Chriſt, and the true Chriſtians Spiritual Way to God, which when I did, or ſpake any thing that added unto my Burden, ever made me ſenſible that it was wrong before I did it; and this aggravated my Sorrow.</p>
               <p>And after ſeveral Months continuance in this dolorous condition, by the Light of Chriſt in my Heart, I ſaw the emptineſs and inſufficiency of all Formal and Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Worſhip of God, that is not in his own Spirit and Truth in the inward parts, which Spirit God ever heareth the cry of, and which Truth he ever loveth, out of which I could not but judge my ſelf to have been, with thoſe I aſſociated my ſelf in that formal inſufficient Worſhip, which was no ſooner ended, but (though Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sins, and Prayer for Repentance (in a ſeeming Zeal) had been made, and Sin preached againſt) yet before parting (and ſometimes in the Worſhip too) the ſpirit and power of the Man of Sin, that tempts into all Sin, aroſe amongſt us, cauſing Laughter, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olly, and Vanty
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61899:54"/>to appear amongſt us, which was far from a State of true Repentance.</p>
               <p>And though of late, before I had kept over the Witneſs of God, the Light in my Conſcience (though it had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved me for Sin) and had been like the reſt of the company with whom I joined in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; yet then the ſence of my own deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate being upon me continually) I could not appear in my former Jollity and Vanity amongſt them; but though mine Eye was chiefly upon mine own condition, yet I could not be unſenſible of their ſtate, which had ſo lately been mine own; but, in the love that thinketh no evil, I mourned over them, and ſorrowed for them, who then began to deride me.</p>
               <p>And after I had thus remained for a Seaſon (till I durſt no longer delay the time) then I began to queſtion them that had been my Teachers, concerning the Light, (the Way of God, and the Juſt Man's Path) which had convinced me of all my Sins, and in my Heart and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reproved me for the ſame; but alas! the Teachers, though profeſſing to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt the Light, yet they were untaught by the Light, and untaught of God, by whom all true Chriſtians are taught, as Chriſt, and his Holy Prophets and Apoſtles declared, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61899:54"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 14.26. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.35, 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p>And being willing to be ſatisfied as fully as I could amongſt them, as well concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light, as their doubtful Doctrines, Ordinances and Ceremonies, I paſſed over a conſiderable time, in reaſoning and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with thoſe of my Teacher, whom I judged moſt able; but though the moſt (or all) of them underſtood ſeveral Languages, yet none of them owned the true Light wherewith Jeſus Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth every Man (and Woman) that cometh into the World to be ſaving,<note place="margin">John 1.9.</note> or of ſufficiency to lead to Salvation, whereby I plainly ſaw that they were as Strangers to it and had not tryed the Vertue of it.</p>
               <p>For the Scriptures alſo are herein very plain,<note place="margin">John 1.1, 4, 9.</note> that this Light is the Life which was in the Eternal Word (which is Chriſt) which was in the beginning with God, which Word was (and is) God; and ſo this Light is certainly divine, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſufficient to lead to Salvation, all that faithfully give up with all their Hearts,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12. Eph. 2.8. 2 Cor. 12.9.</note> to follow it and obey its Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and this Light is the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, which hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all Men, and was the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Teacher, and by it they were ſaved, through Faith; for it was and is ſufficient;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61899:55"/>and it was and is the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Chriſt which is given to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man to profit withal;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7.

               <p>But the ſaid Teachers ſaid, That Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was now ceaſed, and that in our days none muſt expect to enjoy God or Chriſt in his inward appearance in the Heart, Soul, and Conſcience, in which his Servants the Prophets, Apoſtles, and true Chriſtians enjoyed him in days paſt, but that now God hath in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, called the Bible, given us wholly to underſtand our Duty towards him, and one unto another, and that none can know God but by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And indeed none can know God but by that which the Scriptures declare of, which is the Light or Spirit, for I then knew certainly that though I had often (with zeal and delight) read the Scriptures, yet I knew not rightly my own condition, nor how far I was from the ſtate of a true Chriſtian, till I gave diligent heed to the Light, of Chriſt, the Grace of God in my own Heart and Conſcience; and as I waited low in it, by it I received a clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61899:55"/>of my own ſtate towards God, and what was needful for me to know.</p>
               <p>And though the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Of a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> (yet, ſaith he it is) <hi>through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Mark that,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.6, 7, 8.</note> It is through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, the Light, and the Word of Faith nigh in the Heart, and in the Mouth. And ſaith <hi>Paul, All Scripture given by Inſpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works.</hi> So they that deny Perfection through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, to be attainable on this ſide the Grave, for which end the Scriptures, by the Inſpiration of God, were given; do not ſuch deny the very end for which the Scriptures were given?</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not write (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Tranſlation) that <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God;</hi> Take notice of this, for the Word <hi>(Is)</hi> is added, there being nothing for it in the original Greek Copies: And alſo, the Word <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſignifieth Writings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, or bad; and no bad Writings are given by the Inſpiration of God: Therefore they that profeſs the Scriptures to be their Rule and Standard, ſhould not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61899:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>add to their Rule or Standard, leſt they be found to falſify it.</p>
               <p>And ſo, whilſt I was thus reaſoning with my former Teachers, I became fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied concerning their Ignorance of the Truth, and their Inſufficiency to be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Guides to direct in the Way of Salvation, being out of it themſelves; and ſo I became as it were weaned, and in weaning from the Breaſt I had formerly ſucked, which was the Conceivings of the Wiſdom of Men, and in the Eyes of the World I became a Fool, and was reckoned mad, and a Changeling, and I durſt not give way to the Entreaties, nor to the Threatnings, neither of Parent nor Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though near and dear unto me, whoſe Welfare every way I defired, as my own, yet then they became as mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, being mightily offended with me; though after ſome time, more Friendly again then before, ſome of them came to be unto me.</p>
               <p>And when the ſaid Teachers ſaid unto me, <hi>Why do you queſtion our Religion, for we exhort People to Vertue, and to live Holily, and to ſtrive againſt Sin.</hi> I anſwered, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whether is it poſſible that the Soul of Man may be Cleanſed from Sin on this ſide the Grave? They replyed, <hi>No;</hi> then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61899:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſidered I; Ah! then where muſt my Soul be cleanſed; and to ſtrive and fight againſt Sin all the time of a Man's Life, and never to get the Victory, but always to be overcome; ſurely this is not the good Fight of Faith, but a very uncomfortable fighting, when a man knoweth, or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, before he fight, that he certainly muſt be conquered.</p>
               <p>And when they ſaid unto me, <hi>You may live as Holily, and as ſtrictly, and as free from Sin as you can or will, and yet continue of our Religion too, for we command no Vices, nor are not againſt any of our Hearers living holily and ſtrictly, but adviſe them to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I anſwered, Ah! but I am unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and I have read in the Scriptures, That they who ſeek the Lord with all their Heart ſhall find him; and I believe this is true; but alas! I have not yet found him to my Satisfaction, and I am reſolved (whatever cometh) to ſeek him with all my Heart, and I hope that I ſhall find him; and ſo I conſidered, that he who would find the Lord to his ſatisfaction, and enjoy his Bleſſing, muſt not walk in the Counſel of the Ungodly, nor ſtand in the Way of Sinners, and ſo I durſt no longer join with them in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>For I believed, that they who ſeek God aright, and ſo find him to their Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, muſt ſeek him Inwardly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61899:57"/>for he is a Spirit, and is not to be found in Carnal Ordinances, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Traditions of Men, which the ſaid Teachers pleaded for; and I had been very zealous in thoſe things, but found no profit, until I took heed to the Light of Chriſt in mine own Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>And as I continued waiting upon God in his Light, and taking heed unto it, the Day dawned more and more upon me, and the Day-Star aroſe in my Heart, and I plainly ſaw the emptineſs of all outward Ceremonies, invented in the woſul Night of Apoſtaſy, and ſet up (when the Power of Darkneſs ruled in the Heart) by ſuch as were diſobedient to the Light, in their own Wills, and for filthy Lucres ſake.</p>
               <p>And I came to ſee plainly, that the true Worſhip of God is only performed in his own Spirit and Truth, the Mani eſtation whereof is the true Light, out of which none can know God, nor worſhip him accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but worſhip they know not what; and the Worſhip of God is in Fear and Trembling before him, and at his Word in the Heart, and ſuch are accepted of God, and ſhall be accepted with him, and with ſuch he will dwell, as the Scriptures largely teſtifie; read <hi>John</hi> 4.20, to 25. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2, 5. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.4. and 10.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.21, 22. and 33.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.26.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61899:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And ſo I durſt not but deny all Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips preſcribed by the Wiſdom of Men, and ſet-up by Men, which were not in the Spirit and Truth of God; neither durſt I embrace the Pleaſures or Preferments of the World, for I was ſenſible both of their danger and Vanity, and that the Words of Chriſt were true, who ſaid, <hi>If any man will come after me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 9.23, 24, 25. Luke 14.27.</note> 
                  <hi>let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me, and whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and follow me, cannot be my Diſciple; for whoſoever will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever will loſe his Life for my ſake, the ſame ſhall ſave it; for what is a man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged if he gain the whole World, and loſe himſelf, or be caſt away?</hi>

            <div type="signs_of_antichrist">
               <p>And now I am not of their Perſwaſion, who believe that there is no Salvation, nor Freedom from Sin on this ſide the Grave, and that the Souls of true Chriſtians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cleanſed from Sin while their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies live in this World; for that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Truth, and to the Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures; and where Sin hath a place in the Heart or Soul of any, there the Man of Sin hath a place, whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and Lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his Mouth, and ſhall deſtroy

               <p>And ſo whilſt they diſobey the Word of the Kingdom, the Light in themſelves, they are making themſelves Strangers to God and his Kingdom, through diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſo are unlike to be Inheritors of it, though they make never ſo large a Profeſſion of ſeeking it in their Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, outward Shews and Signs; for there it is not to be found, much leſs inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</p>

               <p>And <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who baptized with Water to Repentance, we read not that he baptized Infants; for what ſhould In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants repent of? but he Preached, ſaying, <hi>Repene ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> So it ſeemeth the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was near then; and to ſome who came to his Baptiſm, he ſaid, <hi>O, Generation of Vipees, who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come? bring forth therefore Fruits meet for Repentance, or</hi> (as ſome tranſlate) <hi>anſwerable to amendment of Life; for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Ax is laid to the Root of the Tree;</hi>

               <p>So it ſeemeth, they that came to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, which was with Water to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, if they brought not forth Fruits meet for Repentance, they were little or no better, being to be hewn down, and caſt into the Fire: And where can any read that <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, being outward, could make any true Chriſtians? Was it not before Chriſt, that <hi>John</hi> came Baptizing with Water? and before there were any called Chriſtians? for we read not of that Name given till after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt; and if <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm could not

               </p>
               <p>And what a ſtrange thing doth it ſeem, that any ſhould believe (which ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that Sprinkling an Infant with a little Water, (ſome after one manner, and ſome after another) ſhould make it a true Chriſtian? For true Chriſtians are Members of Chriſt, and Children of God, and Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; but no Man can make them ſo: for it is only by believing in the Light of Chriſt, and obeying it, that a true Chriſtian ſtate is atta ned unto; and ſo true Chriſtians are

               <p>But it is a very poor Evidence, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo great a matter, as Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or true Chriſtianity is, only to be told to a Man (or Woman) or to ſee it written in a Book, that when he was an Infant, or a Child of a few days old, he was baptized and made a Chriſtian; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he knoweth nothing of certainty that he is ſo; but rather hath an Evidence in his own Heart, plainly and truly witneſſing that he is in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity, and is not led and guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, as true Chriſtians are; and ſo if he weightily examine himſelf, he may find his eſtate (to be otherwiſe then ſome would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to believe of it) and ſee it to be very Miſerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> bare Teſtimony of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>There cometh one after me, which is preferred before me, for he was before me, and I knew him not; but that he ſhould be made manifeſt to</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,<note place="margin">John 1.30, 31, 32, 33. John 3.30.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore am I come baptizing with Water:</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>The ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit;</hi> and ſaid he, <hi>he muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61899:60"/>
               <p>So it is plain, that the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> Baptized with Water, was, that Chriſt, and his Spiritual Baptiſm, (which only can render Men true <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) ſhould be made manifeſt to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but there can be no ſuch Reaſon given for Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; for Chriſt and Baptiſm hath been long talked of by Sprinklers of Infants, and ſtill both Hearers and Preachers, ſtrangers to Chriſt and his Baptiſm; how then ſhould they make him, or his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm manifeſt or known to little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants?</p>
               <p>And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3.3.</note> but they who believe in the Light, the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Word of God in their Hearts,<note place="margin">Look in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> and ſo become Children of the Light, and of God, being Born again, (or <hi>from above,</hi> as the Word implieth) they in the Light ſee and diſcern the Kingdom of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> which conſiſteth in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit (or Ghoſt) which are inwardly to be known.</p>
               <p>And this Sign of Baptiſm, wherewith now adays they ſign Infants, and reckon it a Badge of Chriſtianity, they call a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (and ſome ſay there are Seven Sacraments, and others ſay, but two, to be uſed in the Church of Chriſt) though
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61899:61"/>in all the Holy Scriptures they find no mention of the Word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and they ſay, It was commanded by Chriſt, becauſe he ſaid to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Go, teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Baptizing them in,</hi> or (when truly tranſlated) <hi>into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, here he firſt bad them to teach them; ſo they ſhould let Teaching be before Baptizing: But how can they teach Infants? And he commanded this to his Diſciples, who were learners of him, and Witneſſes of his Reſurrection; but they are not ſuch, who act contrary to his Commands.</p>
               <p>And he bad them to Baptize into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Now this Name of God is called the Word, Light, Love, and Holy Spirit, which is placed in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Temple, where God dwelleth, of which,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.5. 1 Kings 8.29. 2 Chron. 7.12. 2 Cor. 3.16.</note> the Temple that <hi>Solomon</hi> built, was a Type, or Figure, in which he ſaid he would place his Name, which outward Temple was deſtroyed; but true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are the holy Spiritual Temple of God, and it was propheſied, the Glory of the ſecond Temple ſhould exceed that of the firſt, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>But they who pretend to baptize Infants with Water,<note place="margin">Rev 19 13.</note> they do not believe in the Name of God, which is his Word and Light in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61899:61"/>Heart; and ſo they are not like to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize either Infants, or others, in it, or into it, being out of it themſelves.</p>
               <p>And in the Command of Chriſt there is no mention at all of Water, for the Diſciples to baptize withal; they being to preach Repentance and Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins in his Name, among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.47, 49.</note> 
                  <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſend the Promiſe of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>until ye be endued with Power from on High:</hi> And ſo they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> until they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Power from on High; and then they declared what the Promiſe of the Father was, that Chriſt had ſent upon them, even that which was ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Joel; And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days (ſaith God) I will pour of my Spirit upon all Fleſh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2.16, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſie; and your Young Men ſhall ſee Viſions, and your Old Men ſhall dream Dreams; and on my Servants, and on my Handmaidens, I will pour out in theſe days of my Spirit, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Diſciples of Chriſt preached other Doctrine then the Sprinklers of Infants, and the pretending Baptizers of this Age preach, for they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear of the Spirit of God being
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61899:62"/>poured out upon all Fleſh, but they mock at the Movings of the Spirit of God in his Servants and Handmaidens, as if there were no ſuch thing now; which ſheweth that they are not endued with Power from on High, and ſo they are ſhort of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who was ſent of God,<note place="margin">John 1.6, 7.</note> and ſaid, <hi>A man can receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, except it be given him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> John 3.27.</p>
               <p>And ſo, they having no Authority from God, but only from Men, take upon them to ſprinkle Infants after the Ordinances of Men, and call it Baptiſm, having a ridiculous Cuſtom of uſing Godfathers, and Godmothers, as they call them, and another of ſigning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the Forehead with the Sign of the Croſs, ſome uſing Oyl, Spittle, Salt, and other ſilly Ceremonies, having nothing at all in the Holy Scriptures to warrant ſuch things, being invented in the Apoſtaſy, in the deceitful Wiſdom of the Antichriſtian Spirit, that hath prevailed, and drawn from the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of true Chriſtianity, into the love of outward Signs, which are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Another Argument, for their Cuſtom of Sprinkling Infants, is, the Words that Chriſt ſpake, ſaying, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61899:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>not, for ſuch is the Kingdom of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 10.14,15.</note> 
                  <hi>and whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he ſhall not enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now they who ſprinkle Infants, bring them to Water, which Chriſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; but do they bring them to Chriſt? Nay, do they not rather keep them from him? teaching them to kneel down, and ask Bleſſing of them called their Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and teaching them to ſay, that by or in Baptiſm in their Infancy, they are made Members of Chriſt, and Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven; and ſo do they not train them up after the Traditions of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt?</p>
               <p>And do not many, called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in their Profeſſion of Religion, compel their Children to theſe things, in their Childhood? Is it not Blaſphemy and Idolatry thus to teach, and practiſe? and whether ſuch things be bringing Children to Chriſt, or keeping them from him, and from his Light, and Grace, and the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Spirit (wherewith every one ought to profit) let the honeſt, ſingle hearted judge.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61899:63"/>
               <p>And concerning the Saying of Chriſt, that, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God as a little Child, he ſhall not enter therein:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> That is no proof of the need of Water, for true Chriſtians are Children of the Light, and are born of the Incorruptible Word of God, which liveth,<note place="margin">John 3.5.</note> and abideth for ever; and ſuch (though they be Men in outward Stature, yet) are as little Children; being little and low in their own eſteem.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> (And this ſome alledge for proof of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm, though neither Infant nor outward Water be mentioned, for a Man is not an Infant) and here Chriſt ſpeaketh of the Spiritual Water (which waſheth the inſide unto Regeneration, or the New Birth)<note place="margin">Zech. 13.</note> which ſpringeth out of the Fountain opened to the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and to the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> for Sin and for Uncleanneſs, which alſo purgeth from Idolatry and falſe Prophecy;<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1.</note> as was propheſied.</p>
               <p>And to theſe Waters, every one that thirſteth, may come, and buy without Money, and without Price: (So they need not give Money to be ſprinkled) And Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">John 7.37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink; and he that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61899:63"/>believeth on me, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of Living Water;</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>I will give unto him that is athirſt, of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21.6. Joh. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and he that drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, it ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up unto Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is this Spiritual Water that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly waſheth and regenerateth unto Eternal Life, without the waſhing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none can enter into the Kingdom of God; and they that are born of this Water and of the Spirit, they are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light, and of the Kingdom of God, and they are truly as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the receiving of his Kingdom, though they be outwardly Men of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writing to the Chriſtians, calleth them Little Children, ſaying, <hi>If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So it appeareth, that the Children of the Light, the Children of God, who had received and believed in the Word of Faith in the Heart, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached, the Word of the Kingdom of God, and were born of it, they were frequently called little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; therefore that ſaying (to wit, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he ſhall not enter therein</hi>) maketh nothing for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prieſts Infant Baptiſm, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any warrant for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And let every one that readeth this, take diligent notice of what is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted, which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> wrote to them which he called little Children, and ſeriouſly examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether they be ſuch little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and whether their Teachers teach ſuch, or the ſame Doctrine, either to Children or others, and if they perceive any difference, it is good for them weightily to conſider it. For the ſingle Eye can ſee plainly that it is becauſe People have neglected the Subſtance, that they have idolized the Shadow;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61899:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>and being by their ſubtil Enemy decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and drawn from obedience to the Light of Chriſt in their own Hearts and Conſciences, they are become dark and vain in their Imaginations, and walk in Darkneſs, and know not whither they go; or elſe they could not ſurely for ſhame talk of Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, and of Men making Infants Children of God, and Members of Chriſt, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet profeſs the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be their Rule, which mention no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome may ſay, That out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Water Baptiſm is a Sacrament, wherein there is an outward viſible Sign of an inward Spiritual Grace, and if it do Children no good, (ſay they) it can do them no hurt. It is granted, that whilſt they are not capable of underſtanding, it can neither do them hurt nor good; but when they come to be taught a Lye, that is, to believe that by Baptiſm in their Infancy they were made Chriſtians, and Members of Chriſt, that doth them much hurt, as I have in my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular experienced; for becauſe of ſuch teachings, when I was young, I was ready to conclude my ſelf to be a Chriſtian, and a Child of God, whenas the Grace of God in my own Heart (which they told
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61899:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>me my Baptiſm was a ſign of) teſtified plainly to me, that it was not ſo with me, and that my condition was very dangerous, and yet I then ſhould have thought my ſelf highly affronted, if any Man had told me ſo.</p>
               <p>And ſo I know by experience, that my being taught to believe and depend upon the outward viſible Sign, made me to neglect the Teachings of the inward ſpiritual Grace of God in my own Heart and Conſcience; and made me more ſecure and careleſs of my Duty towards God, in not anſwering the requirings and teachings of his Grace, in order that I might be prepared to render an account to God of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which he had given me; and ſo I ſaw perfectly (before I left them) that my Teachers had deceived me, as it was formerly, the Leaders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cauſed them to err,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.16.</note> and they that were led of them, were deſtroyed.</p>

               <p>But ſome may think that outward Water Baptiſm is a Seal of Chriſtianity, and therefore to be uſed, becauſe in ſome Caſes, and to ſome People it was uſed by the Apoſtles, among the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſitans, as they can read:</p>
               <p>As to its being a Seal of Chriſtianity; if it were a Seal to one, it is likewiſe ſo to others that have it, and ſo a Seal to them all; but no outward Sign is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be a Seal to true Chriſtianity, for it is Inward and Spiritual, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be known by any outward Seal, neither doth it admit of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of any ſuch outward Seal, for true Chriſtians are ſealed by the Holy Spirit of God to the Day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note> and ſo they need no outward Seal; for if an outward ſeal would do, many would get that upon their own terms; and ſo many get outward Baptiſm for Money, which pleaſeth the Prieſts well, though it profiteth nothing to the buyer of it: But it is the true, inward, Spiritual Baptiſm of Chriſt that is the true Seal wherewith all true Chriſtians are ſealed to the Day of Redemption, by the Spirit of God.</p>

                  <hi>or Elements</hi>) <hi>of the world, why as though living in the World, are ye ſubject to Ordinances? or</hi> (as ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate) <hi>burdened with Traditions; touch

               <p>Thus it is very plain, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here writeth of the Spiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſion of Chriſt, and of his Spiritual Baptiſm through the Faith of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or working, of God; and was far from preaching up ſuch outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, declaring that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and contrary to them, who were true Chriſtians, and he bad them not to touch, taſte, nor handle ſuch things; ſaying they were all to periſh with the uſing after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men: And ſo now the Commanders and Teachers of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Water-Baptiſm (as alſo of their other Ordinances and Traditions) ſome of them command and teach it after one way, and others after other ways, and yet all profeſs the Scriptures to be their Rule, and therefore ſome of them are erred from the direction of their Rule; yea, are they not all erred from their profeſſed Rule? for the Scriptures plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie againſt ſuch Ordinances and Traditions, as being contrary to true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But theſe Baptizers for Money are ſo far erred from the Light and Grace
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61899:68"/>of Chriſt in themſelves (which the Scriptures teſtifie of) and now are ſo darkned by the dark, deceitful Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Spirit, that they alledge the foreſaid 11th and 12th. Verſes of the ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to be their proof for the Inſtitution of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm in the room of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; whenas the ſaid Verſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the remainder of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plainly ſheweth otherwiſe, as is before rehearſed, even the 20th, 21ſt, and 22d, Verſes of it.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> intimateth, that the Salvation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family in the Ark by, or in Water, was a Type or Figure of Baptiſm inwardly, ſaying, <hi>The Antitype whereunto, even Baptiſm doth now ſave us,</hi>

                  </gap>, that is, the thing figured, or typified, or ſignified, or the Antitype: So here is a great difference between the common Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation; which ſaith, <hi>The like Figure;</hi> and what it ſhould be, that is, <hi>the thing figured:</hi> And it is plain, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm here ſpoken of, was more than a Figure, being the Subſtantial Spiritual
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61899:68"/>Baptiſm of Chriſt, <hi>which</hi> (ſaid <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>ſaveth us by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>

               <p>And ſo according to the Scriptures, there is as much Reaſon for them that uſe Water Baptiſm, to ſay that it was inſtituted inſtead of the ſaving by the Water of the Flood in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> as that it was inſtituted in the room or ſtead of Circumciſion; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mention that to be a Type of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but not Circumciſion; and we read not that the Apoſtles preached up one outward Ordinance in the room of any other.</p>
               <p>But the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> with Water unto Repentance, did plainly, by a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or Sign, ſhew or typifie the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm of Chriſt to weak Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and to them who were unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Spiritual Waſhing and Cleanſing, by his Blood,<note place="margin">1 John 1.7.</note> which clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them that walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, from all Sin; and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and ſpeaking of Thieves, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,

               <p>For he told the ſaid <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

               <p>And the Meſſage of <hi>Paul</hi> was, to open the Eyes of People, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they might receive Forgiveneſs of Sins,<note place="margin">Acts 26.17, 18.</note> and Inheritance among them which are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Faith in Chriſt; and it was agreeable to the Meſſage which the other Apoſtles had to declare,<note place="margin">1 John 1.5.</note>

               </p>
               <p>So by all theſe Sayings, it is plain, and evident, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and the true Apoſtles preached up the One, Spiritual Baptiſm of Chriſt, which only renders men true Chriſtians, Children of God, and Members of Chriſt, although they did ſometimes comply with the weakneſs of ſome concerning outward Baptiſm, to gain them to the Truth, and to inſtruct them in the Myſtery of Godlineſs,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.20, 21, 22. Acts 16.3.</note> and in the Knowledge of the Spiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Chriſt; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> declared, ſaying, <hi>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the Weak,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore he circumciſed <hi>Timothy;</hi> and ſo if any pretend to follow the Example of the Apoſtles, in baptizing with outward Water, they may as well, by the ſame pretence, uſe Circumciſion alſo: And <hi>Paul</hi> alſo complied to purifie himſelf
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61899:70"/>according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the ſake of many of the <hi>Jews</hi> that beheved, but were zealous of the Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.20, to 27. And ſo the pretending Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizers, with as much warrant, may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Apoſtle in Purification accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But although <hi>Paul,</hi> in Chriſtian liberty, did ſuch things in compliance with them that were weak in the Faith, (in order to bring them out of their many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, rather than keep them in them) yet he could not do ſo for fear of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeution, he would not be compelled to ſuch things, neither do them for the gain of Money, nor the like; for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>As many as deſire to make a Fair ſhew in the Fleſh they conſtrain you to be circumciſed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.12. Gal. 5.11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>So it ſeemeth that ſome profeſſing Chriſtianity (who were not obedient to the Light of Chriſt in their own Hearts, which teacheth to bear his Croſs patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) preached up Circumciſion, leſt they ſhould have ſuffered Perſecution, and yet ſuch deſired to make a fair ſhew in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61899:71"/>the Fleſh; but the true Miniſters of Chriſt did not ſo, for (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Threats of Men, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Perſecution) in the Faith of the Power of God, and in the love and obedience of the Light of Chriſt in their Hearts, they preached Liberty from all ſuch burdenſome things, and in his Name and Authority preached his Croſs Boldly; and declared that ſuch as preached otherwiſe, were falſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richriſtian.</p>
               <p>And do not many, deſiring to make a fair Shew (of Chriſtianity) in the Fleſh, now preach up Water-Baptiſm, and that of Infants, with other ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for fear of Perſecution, or for Money, and their own carnal ends, not having any authority from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles for ſuch things?</p>
               <p>Therefore let all beware of ſuch falſe Prophets and Deceivers, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forewarned of, ſaying, <hi>Many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many;</hi> and ſaid he, <hi>If any man ſay unto you,</hi>

               <p>And now it is good for all to beware that they truly examine themſelves in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in their Hearts, whether they be really the Children of God, yea, or nay;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16 1 John 5.10.</note> and they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, for he that is of God, hath the Witneſs in himſelf God giveth to his Children to Know that he is their Father, and that they are his Children; but the Man of Sin, he would not that

               <p>And I know by certain experience that though I was, in my Childhood and Youth, told by my Parents, and others, that I was baptized in my Infancy, and that ſuch were my Godfathers, and ſuch a one was my Godmother (of whom I was taught Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly to ask Bleſſing) and alſo was taught (according to their Catechiſm) that in that Baptiſm I was made a Member of Chriſt, and a Child of God, and an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritour of the Kingdom of Heaven; and I was ſo trained up in my Youth by my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (yet in a ſomewhat moderate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) and being held in this implicite Faith, (by yielding to the power of Darkneſs) I was prevailed upon to ſtand as a Godfather (as they term it) to three Children which were ſprinkled with Water.</p>

               <p>And bleſſed be the Day wherein I firſt received the reproof of the Light in the Love of it, for there had been a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I had ſlighted its Reproofs; and when it troubled me in my Heart and Conſcience for my Sins then I ſometimes gat amongſt ſuch as are called merry Company to put the trouble away; but well was it for me that the reproof purſued me, until I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly received it in its love; and then in ſome little time I ſaw Sin to be exceeding ſinful, yea and loathſom too; and I became weary of it; and could no longer delight in folly and vanity (where Sin ever dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) no more then a man can delight to ſee others to laugh at him for his being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly full of grievous Wounds, and

               <p>And ſo my greateſt need and deſire was to be inwardly healed, (for I ſaw I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to heal others, or to aſſiſt to make them Children of God, being in that forlorn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) for I ſaw my ſelf to be in extream need of an able Phyſician; and therefore I conſulted them that had been my Teachers, who pretended to be Divines, and ſpiritual Phyſicians (having great need of ſuch a one) and they told me that my diſtemper could not be cured on this ſide the Grave, and ſaid it was not to be expected that any Soul of Man can be cleanſed from Sin and from the contagion of it, and have the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Wourds and Bruiſes and loathſome Sores that Sin hath made all over it, to be cured, till its Body dye.</p>

               <p>And ſo there is a great difference between the Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe Labour and Travail was and is to turn People from Darkneſs to Light, that they may believe in it, become Children of it, and walk in it, and come out of the uſe of outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Elements, into the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in his Spirit, and Light: And the Miniſters of the Man of Sin, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is to keep People from believing in the Light, and in the ſufficiency of it, and ſo to keep them in Darkneſs, where ſin, and the Works of darkneſs are done, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reproved by the Light; and ſo to keep People in the uſe of ſuch outward Signs, Ceremonies, Ordinances, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (in their Vain and Ignorant Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) which are Taught variouſly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Traditions and Doctrines of Men; and that for their Gain of Tythes, Money, and outward Preferment, far different from the expectation of the Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe Travail and Preaching often is, and hath been in the hazard of their Lives, and outward Eſtates.</p>
               <p>And they that receive, believe in, walk in, and continue in the New Covenant of the Everlaſting Goſpel of God, which is the Light, Grace, Law, and Spirit of God in their Hearts, there is no need for them to be ſubject to Ordinances of Men, nor to be burdened writh ther Traditions,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> nor to be

               <p>And Chriſt ſaid, If any Man eat of this Bread, he ſhall live for ever, and ſaith he, The Bread that I will give is my Fleſh;<note place="margin">John 6.32, 33, to 63.</note> which I will give for the Life of the World; and he ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you; whoſo eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt Day; for my Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: He that eateth my Fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him; as the Living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father, ſo he that eateth me ſhall live by me: This is the Bread that came down from Heaven; not as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eat <hi>Manna,</hi> and are dead, he that eateth this Bread ſhall live for ever; and to them that murmured at theſe ſayings, Chriſt ſaid, Doth this offend you?

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61899:89"/>the Fleſh profiteth nothing: The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is plain,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.4.</note> that true Chriſtians live by the words that Chriſt ſpeaketh in their Hearts, and Souls, and Conſciences, by his Light and Grace, the anſwering of which in faithful Obedience, is as Meat and Drink to their Souls, and they know the Law of the Mouth of God to be better unto them,<note place="margin">John 14.10. Pſal. 119.72. Mal. 2.7.</note> than Thouſands of Gold and Silver: And as in Times paſt under the Law, the Prieſts Lips were to keep Knowledge,<note place="margin">Col. 2.3.</note> and the People were to ſeek the Law at his Mouth; ſo the Lips of Chriſt, (who is a Prieſt for ever after the Order of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi>) they keep Knowledge, and in him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, and all true Chriſtians inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek the Law at his Mouth, and their Souls live by the words that proceed out of it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.8.9. 1 Tim. 6.16.

               <p>But they that believe not in the Light of Chriſt in their Hearts, but rebel againſt it, and kick againſt the Pricks, and Reproofs of it; how ſhould ſuch be ſatisfied with the fatneſs of God's Houſe? Or how ſhould ſuch know an eating of the Bread that Chriſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61899:89"/>giveth, which is his Fleſh and Blood, and a dwelling in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them? Or how ſhould ſuch know the words that Chriſt ſpeaketh unto them, by his Light, Grace, and Spirit in their Hearts, to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life unto their Souls? And if they know not, neither witneſs theſe things in ſome meaſure in themſelves, how then can they know themſelves to be true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</p>
               <p>For true Chriſtians know that they are of God, and the whole World lyeth in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and can truly ſay,<note place="margin">1 John 5.18, 19, 20.</note> We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an Underſtanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; this is the true God and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Alſo to them who believed in the Light,<note place="margin">John 8.12.</note> and learned to deny themſelves, and follow him, that they might enjoy the Light of Life, Chriſt ſaid, I am the true Vine, my Father is the Husbandman, ye are the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much Fruit,<note place="margin">John 15.</note> for without me ye can do nothing; if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you; herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much Fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; as the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue ye in my love: If ye keep my Commandments ye ſhall abide in my love; this is my Commandment, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61899:90"/>ye love one another even as I have loved you: If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you; if ye were of the World, the World would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you. And as Chriſt ſaid, I am the true Vine, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Husbandman, he alſo ſaid, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Branch IN ME that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away; and every Branch that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Fruit,<note place="margin">John 15.</note> he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more Fruit: Now (ſaid he to his) are ye clean through the Word that I have ſpoken unto you; abide in me, and I in you; as the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me, for without me ye can do nothing: If a Man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a Branch, and is wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And ſo they that are true Chriſtians, and Children of God, and Members of Chriſt, being Taught by his Light and Grace in their Hearts in which they have believed, they are Branches of Chriſt the true Vine, and they partake of the Nouriſhment, that through the true Vine is extended unto them the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; as they abide in the Vine; but they that abide not in him the Vine, are caſt forth as Branches, and are withered; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to the other ſaying of Chriſt, to wit, Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61899:90"/>Man, and drink his Blood,<note place="margin">John 6.53.</note> ye have no Life in you.</p>
               <p>For this anſwereth to the eating of the Fleſh, and drinking of the Blood of Chriſt: And as the Branches in the Vine live by Nouriſhment of the Life of the Vine, in whom they abide; ſo they that eat the Fleſh, and drink the Blood of Chriſt, ſaith he, they dwell in me, and I in them;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.27. Eph. 4.16. Eph. 5.29, 30.</note> and he that eate home ſhall live by me, ſaith Chriſt: And ſo the Branches of the Vine feed upon, and drink or ſuck in of the Sap, or Life of the Vine, and live by it; as alſo the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body do, by the Nouriſhment of the Body.</p>
               <p>And alſo Chriſt ſaid, I am the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, the good Shepherd giveth his Life for the Sheep: And ſaid he, I know my Sheep, and am known of mine; for (ſaith he) they know my Voice, and they ſollow me,<note place="margin">John 10.</note> and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any Man pluck them out of my Hand; but he ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> (who believed not in the Light as he commanded, but were Taught by the Doctrines and Traditions of Men) ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, becauſe ye are not of my Sheep, as I ſaid unto you; my Sheep hear my Voice.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt is the good Shepherd, who feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Sheep with his own Life, as well as the true Vine, whereof his Sheep are the Branches,<note place="margin">John 6.48, to 58.</note> and partake of the very Life and Nature of him the Vine, who is the Bread of Life, of which if any Man eat, he ſhall live
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61899:91"/>for ever, and dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him; and ſo they are as the Vine and the Branches dwelling in each other, and ſuch Branches bear Fruit to the Glory of the Vine in which they dwell, which Fruit and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are precious in the Eye of God the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, to whom Glory belongs, and is aſcribed for ever: And theſe Branches are the Sheep of Chriſt their good Shepherd, and they hear, and diligently hearken unto the Voice, or Light, or Manifeſtation of his Spirit in their Hearts, and the words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto them ſpoken, they are SPIRIT, and they are LIFE; and ſo they know his quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening Spirit to miniſter Life to their Souls, in which they live, and grow, and bring forth excellent,<note place="margin">Iſa 4.2, 3, 4.</note> and comely Fruit, whereby God their Heavenly Father is glorified.</p>
               <p>And becauſe many believe not the words of Chriſt concerning the eating of the Bread of Life, and the eating of his Fleſh, and drinking of his Blood, but murmured, and went back, and walked no more with him; therefore he ſaid to the Twelve Diſciples, Will ye alſo go away?<note place="margin">John 6.66, to 70.</note> And one anſwered, ſaying, Lord to whom ſhall we go? Thou haſt the words of Eternal Life, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the Living God: So they were ſatisfied, and knew him by the words of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, which he ſpake unto them: And ſo he will ſatisfie all who truly hunger and thirſt after him, by the words of his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61899:91"/>Spirit, if they believe in the Light, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that are in Unbelief and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Light in their own Hearts, they have no ſuch ſatisfaction, for the Light which inwardly reproveth them for ſin and diſobedience, is the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Chriſt, by which he ſpeaketh unto his Sheep, who know his Voice, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth them with the words of Eternal Life, and with the Bread of Life, and Water of Life, unto which,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But they that Rebel againſt the Light,<note place="margin">Prov. 6.23.</note> and will not hearken to its Reprof, they err from the Way of Life, and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Prov. 21.16.</note> (though never ſo worldly-wiſe) and they remain among the Congregation of the Dead; and cannot (in that ſtate) know a feeding upon the Bread of Life, nor a drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Water of Life, which Chriſt giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Faithful; for they abide not in Chriſt the true Vine, but are caſt forth as Branches, and withered; and it will not profit them at all to have a Name to live, and be dead.</p>
               <p>And this eating of ſpiritual Meat,<note place="margin">1 Con. 0.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> and drinking of ſpiritual Drink, was witneſſed by the Fathers (in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) who were all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cloud, and all paſſed through the Sea, and were all Baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea; for ſaid the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,

               <p>And ſo they that believe in, and faithfully obey the Light of Chriſt, which is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his Holy Spirit, and the Word of his Grace in their Hearts (which is nigh to reprove for ſin) they become Children of the Light, and with his inward Baptiſm, by his own Spirit, they are all Baptized into one Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head; and ſo they are Members of Chriſt, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.11, 12, to 21.</note> whether they be Bond or Free, being all made to drink into his one Spirit; for as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, The Body is not one Member but many; for as the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body, being many,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.5.</note> are one Body, ſo alſo is Chriſt: And ſaith he, If they were all one Member, where were the Body; but now are they many
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61899:92"/>Members, yet but one Body: And theſe all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink, even of the ſpiritual Rock Chriſt Jeſus, of which the Fathers (who were under the Cloud) of old drank, and of which all the Servants, Children, and People of God, and Diſciples, and Members of Chriſt, in all Ages have drunk: Even as all the Members of the Body receive Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from or of the Body, and as all the Branches (or Members) of the Vine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.

               <p>But they that believe not in, but Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light, the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Chriſt in their Hearts, they reſiſt his Holy Spirit, and will not by it be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his one Body, and ſo they are not Members of Chriſt, nor Branches of him the true Vine; nor, they do not receive Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from him, as his Members and Branches do, neither do they know an eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Fleſh, or drinking of his Blood, to have Eternal Life thereby, though they may talk much of it; for the power of Death and Darkneſs, even the Man of Sin, prevaileth over ſuch, and they are ſubject to his unclean, dark, unholy Spirit, and ſo are Servants to him, whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders.

                  <q>I will not drink of the Fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdom of God ſhall come;</q> and ſaid he, <q>Ye are they which have continued with me in my Temptations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom:<note place="margin">Luke 22.15, to 38.</note> And ſaid he, I ſay unto you, That this that is written muſt yet be accompliſhed in me; he was numbred among the Tranſgreſſors; for the Things concerning me have an end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which words it is plain, that Chriſt appointed to his Diſciples, that they ſhould eat and drink ſpiritually at his Spiritual Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in his heavenly Kingdom, which was within them; which ſhall never have an end, and that the outward things concerning him were to have an end; for the inward or ſpiritual things concerning him have no end: And ſo, by the outward Bread and Wine which he gave them, he inſtructed them in the knowledge of their ſpiritual eating of the daily Bread of Life,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.5, to 15. John 6.51.</note> without which no Soul can live to God, which he bade them to pray in ſecret for, which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life, which Bread Chriſt giveth, which is his Fleſh: And alſo in the knowledge of their ſpiritual drinking of the new and ſpiritual Wine (in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) which is his Blood, and is alſo the Living Water which he freely giveth, and inviteth all and every one that is athirſt to come unto,<note place="margin">John 4.10, 13, 14.</note> and take; which Water who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever drinketh ſhall never thirſt (their

               </p>
               <p>Now obſerve, it was Chriſt's Diſciples, who had learned of him, to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to take up their Croſs (to their own wills) daily; and who had left all to follow him, with whom he deſired to eat, and did eat the Paſſeover, and whom he ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Bread and Wine, which ſhewed forth his Death: But there was a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe his Diſciples, and the Prieſts of thoſe Times,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> who were very ſtrict in keeping the Paſſeover, which Typified Chriſt, the true Paſſeover, and cauſed him to be Crucified, and ſo all that will not be inſtructed by the Light of Chriſt, in their own Hearts, nor learn of him, that they may truly be his Diſciples, nor will not deny themſelves, nor take up their Croſs, nor follow Chriſt ſpiritually; ſuch may be ſtrict in their outward Performances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they know not what they do, Crucifying Chriſt afreſh in their Affections, and in their Luſts; but God is diſpleaſed with all ſuch their Performances. And they who diſobey the Light of Chriſt in their own Hearts and Conſciences, are all ignorant of the true ſpiritual Food, which Chriſt daily miniſtreth to the Souls of the Children of the Light;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61899:97"/>and ſuch depend upon the Shadow or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, not enjoying the Subſtance; and as ſuch (as they) did by Chriſt formerly, ſo now they number among Tranſgreſſors the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, who feed upon the Bread of Life, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, and know the end of the things concerning him.</p>
               <p>Now People may eat Bread, and drink Wine in remembrance of Chriſt, and of his Death alſo, and yet not ſpiritually eat the Fleſh, nor drink the Blood of Chriſt, for they are two different things; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> reproving the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for ſome abuſes about their eating and drinking in their Aſſemblies, and of themſelves, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the words of Chriſt, to wit, this do in remembrance of me;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20. to 28.</note> and concerning the Cup, he renders the Command thus, to wit, this do as oft as ye do it in remembrance of me; and ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> As often as ye ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come; wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink the Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Where it is to be obſerved, that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> being newly Convinced, and in a weak eſtate of Faith, of which mention is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made in this firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to them, and being in the uſe of this Ceremony of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61899:97"/>and drinking in their Aſſemblies, they performed it as a Religious Act, and ſo it is to all thoſe that uſe it as a Religious Act, for as much as therein their end is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Lord's Body that was Crucified for them, and his Blood that was ſhed for them; and to ſhew the Lord's Death: But to remember the Lord, and his Body, and Blood, and to ſhew forth his Death, is not the ſame as to partake of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt; for the Lord and his Death may be remembred by thoſe who do not truly partake of his Fleſh and Blood.</p>
               <p>And the words of the Command mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Paul,</hi> are alſo to be conſidered, to wit, This do as oft as ye do it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me; which Command doth not imply, that they were always to continue in that Ceremony of outward eating and drinking in their Aſſemblies, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt; the continuance of it was not ſo poſitively commanded,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.9, to 14.</note> as the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Circumciſion was, and alſo of keeping the Paſſeover; for Circumciſion was commanded of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.14.</note> to be in their Fleſh for an Everlaſting Covenant; and the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was commanded of God,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.2, 3. Rom. 2.28. 1 Cor. 5.7. Gal. 4.10.11.</note> to be kept a Feaſt by an Ordinance for ever, and yet the true Apoſtle of Chriſt, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, laboured to bring People out of the outward uſe of them; to witneſs them inwardly in themſelves; but that ſaying in the ſaid Command about the Cup, to wit, As oft as ye do it, implieth, that they were
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61899:98"/>not enjoined how oft they ſhould do it, nor how long they ſhould continue in that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and ſo though the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were then in ſuch a practice; it is not binding upon others to uſe it, no more than was obſervations of Days, or making a difference between Meats.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that do truly partake of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, as he himſelf ſaith, they dwell in him (as the Branches do in the Vine) and he dwelleth in them,<note place="margin">John 6.56. John 15.5.</note> (as the Life of the Vine extendeth thorow all its living Branches) and therefore ſuch cannot but remember him, as naturally as a Man remembereth his natural Food, when hungry or thirſty; and ſo they need no Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to put them in remembrance of him, or of his Death; who always bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the Body the dying of the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.10.</note> that the Life alſo of Jeſus may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in their Body: And ſo ſuch truly know Chriſt to be come, the Aboliſher of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and outward Typical Ordinances.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is good for every one to be a Diſciple of Chriſt (which none can be, but who learneth of him, by his Light, the Manifeſtation of his Spirit in their Hearts, which reproveth for ſin) before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to eat Bread, and drink Wine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew forth his Death, leſt they eat and drink their own Damnation, not diſcerning the Lord's Body: And if any believe it is their Duty ſo to take or uſe Bread and Wine; and make it a matter of Conſcience to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61899:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>yet if they do not ſo prepare, and examine themſelves, as is required of all that appear before the All-ſeeing Eye of God, to perform every Religious Act whatſoever, then ſurely they do it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; and inſtead of feeding upon the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, or of truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring him, or ſhewing forth his Death, they make themſelves guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; and ſo they unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily eating, and drinking the Cup of the Lord, as it is to them, they eat and drink Damnation to themſelves.</p>
               <p>And though ſuch pretend to be ſorry for their ſins, whereby Chriſt is as in them Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and ſeem to be thankful for what Chriſt hath done for them, who laid down his Life for them; yet they are in the ſame Spirit, in which formerly were the <hi>Jews, Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who garniſhed the Sepulchres of the Prophets, and ſaid, If we had lived in the Days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the Blood of the Prophets;<note place="margin">Mat. 23.29.30.</note> but Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Wo unto them, as being guilty of the Blood of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>And if the Command of Chriſt be taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe,<note place="margin">John 13.1, to 16.</note> concerning the Bread and Cup, yet, in peruſal of the Writings of the Beloved Diſciple of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,</hi> we find that Chriſt waſhing his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Feet, enjoined them as ſtrictly to that Ceremony, which he performed with more obſervable Circumſtances, than that of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61899:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bread and Cup; for we read that he roſe from Supper, laid aſide his Garments, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out Water into a Baſon, and began to waſh the Diſciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded; and coming to <hi>Simon Peter, Peter</hi> ſaid, Lord doſt thou waſh my Feet? Jeſus anſwered, What I do thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter; and when <hi>Peter</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let him waſh them, Jeſus anſwered, If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part in me: Then after he had waſhed their Feet, and taken his Garments, and was ſet down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, (with more words) he ſaid unto them; If I your Lord and Maſter have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Feet, for I have given you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</p>
               <p>And ſo may not all (that are willing) ſee, that this Ceremony laſt rehearſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the time when it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or the Circumſtances, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand enjoining the uſe of it, hath as much, or more, in it, to prove it inſtituted by Chriſt, to be a perpetual ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in his Church, as either of the other two Ceremonies, to wit, of Baptiſm, and of Bread and Wine? And yet by thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from the extream groſneſs of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this Ceremony of waſhing Feet is not at all uſed in their Aſſemblies; though their Chriſtianity ſeemeth moſtly to depend upon the uſe of the other two Ceremonies, to wit,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61899:99"/>of their Baptiſm, and of Bread and Wine, amongſt the generality of them that uſe them.</p>
               <p>So they that uſe, plead for, and call Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the Signs or Ceremonies of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and Bread and Wine, as by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Inſtitution of Chriſt, or of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; they may with as much or more reaſon, uſe, and plead for the Ceremonies of waſhing one anothers Feet, and of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing the Sick with Oyl;<note place="margin">Jam. 5.14.</note> and call them Sacraments alſo, (as the Papiſts (who have more of them) do) for either of the laſt mentioned, ſeemeth to be full as poſitively commanded, as being of as much neceſſity, as the other, according to the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
               <p>And they that uſe them in-imitation of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, they may as well uſe Circumciſion, or the outward purifying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and abſtain from Blood, and things ſtrangled, and uſe lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands; but then they ſhould cauſe others to receive the Holy Spirit, by their laying on of Hands, as the Apoſtles did; which thing ſome practice, but not with the like effect, nor is it ſo like to be, whilſt they themſelves (who lay on Hands) do not ſo much as pretend to be guided by the Holy Spirit of God, but mock at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of it; which ſheweth them to have much of the Spirit of the Man of Sin, as alſo they have many of his Signs.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:61899:100"/>
               <p>And as concerning the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans uſing the Ceremony of Bread and Wine, ſo they alſo uſed ſeveral others; for having been accuſtomed to many Ceremonies and Obſervations, they would not eaſily be weaned from them all at once, and therefore might uſe ſome ſuitable Types, which the Apoſtle for a Seaſon ſuffered, in condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their weakneſs, thereby inſtructing them cocerning the Myſtery of Chriſt, and labouring to bring them on by degrees, from their Carnal Conceptions, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt after the Fleſh,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14, to 17.</note> to know him in the Spirit revealed in them, unto them, Baptizing them by his Spirit into his one Body, of which every Member receiveth daily ſuitable Nouriſhment from Chriſt the Head, from whom all the Body by Joints and Bands, having Nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo when the Apoſtle of Chriſt had brought the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to this eſtate, and to know Chriſt in them the hope of Glory, then he labours to bring them quite out of the uſe of Ordinances and Ceremonies, as may be read at large in the firſt and ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Epiſtle to them; and ſaith he, Why are ye ſubject to Ordinances, touch not, taſte not, handle not; and ſaith he to them alſo, Let no Man judge you in Meat, or in Drink, or in reſpect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath Days, which are a ſhadow of things to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61899:100"/>come, but the Body is of Chriſt, or in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And alſo when the <hi>Galatians</hi> came to be Children of God, and that God had ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into their Hearts,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.26. Gal. 4.6, 9. Gal. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to them, Now after ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, whereunto ye deſire again to be in Bondage? And ſaith he to them, Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the Yoak of Bondage.</p>
               <p>And alſo the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.13, 14, 15.</note> who were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times far off, and were as Darkneſs, when they were made nigh, by the Blood of Chriſt, and Children of the Light, and ſaved by Grace, to whom was one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God, and Father of all, above all, through all, and in them all: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.5.6.</note> Chriſt had broken down the middle Wall of Partition;<note place="margin">Eph. 5.5.</note> having aboliſhed in his Fleſh the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances.</p>
               <p>So the uſe of outward Baptiſm, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drinking in the Aſſemblies, of thoſe who had but newly received the Faith of Chriſt, having their Minds lately turned from Darkneſs to Light, it was to inſtruct them (in condeſcention to their weakneſs) in the Myſtery of Chriſt the Subſtance, the Spiritual Purifier, and the Spiritual Rock, and heavenly Bread of Life, which they were to come to know an inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61899:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>partaking of, and feeding upon; and when they came to this ſtate, then they were toſtand in the liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free, and not to be any longer in Bondage to outward Elements, Ceremonies, Ordinances, or Traditions, as is very plain by the Apoſtles Doctrine; for when he wrote againſt outward Ordinances, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Traditions, he no where maketh any Exception at all.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified, That the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> but Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit, and that none ought to judge one another, concerning Meats, or Drink, or obſervation of Days; ſaying, Every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God; ſhewing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that there is no neceſſity for Chriſtians to obſerve them; and alſo writing to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame matter, he plainly giveth the Reaſon further, Why no Man ought ſo to judge, which is, Chriſt's blotting out the Hand-writing of Ordinances,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14. to 17.</note> that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and contrary to us, and taking it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs.</p>
               <p>And as there was no neceſſity for them in the Apoſtles time, ſo now, ſurely there is no occaſion for them; for their outward Water, and outward Bread and Wine, have been long uſed, and preached of amongſt People, and yet People that uſe them, and pay for them, are as ignorant of Chriſt the Spiritual Baptizer, and Spiritual Bread of

               <p>And ſuch Preachers have only their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Men, by which they Preach, and not at all from God, as all true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel have; and ſo their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is quite contrary to the Labour of the Miniſters of Chriſt; for they preach up Signs, Ceremonies, Ordinances, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, and labour to keep People in dependance upon them, which are all to periſh with the uſing, that thereby they may keep them in Ignorance, to receive, admire, and depend upon their Teachings; that for their Preaching they may pay them Wages, Tythes, <hi>Eaſter</hi> Reckonings, <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer</hi> Dues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they call them, or give them Gifts, Rewards, Honours, or Eſteem; and ſo with their Signs, and all their other Endeavours, they labour to keep People from believing in the Sufficiency of the Light of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Acts 20.32.

               <p>And if any Pleaders for Signs or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, think themſelves obliged to the uſe of them, by reaſon of any Command from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, yet they may
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61899:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>certainly know, (and that is more than think) that they make not near ſo great a matter, of the other plain and poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally act quite contrary to many of them, as plainly appeareth; for Chriſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Miniſters,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.8, Mat. 19.27, to 30, Mark 10.28, to 31. Tuke 14.33.</note> ſaying, <hi>Freely ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give;</hi> but becauſe many ſuch Preachers have paid dear for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore perhaps they may not think that Command obliging upon them; but they may read, that they to whom this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given, had left all to follow Chriſt; and Chriſt ſaith, He that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p>And whether ſuch Preachers have freely received or not, all may ſee that they are far from freely giving their Preaching, or Miniſtry, who Perſecute, caſt into Priſon, or make Spoil or Havock of the Goods of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent People, only becauſe they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Teaching, nor pay them for it; nor for their Ceremonies, ſuch as Bread and Wine, and outward Baptiſm, or others, which they make a Trade of to get Money by, which is quite contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles; and ſo ſuch are alſo far from for ſaking all for the ſake of Chriſt, and far from being his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or keeping his Commands.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt ſaid to his Miniſters, <hi>Behold, I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of wolves,</hi>

               <p>And likewiſe Chriſt and his Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſaying,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.33, to 38. Jam. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Swear not at all, neither by heaven, neither by the earth,</hi> neither by any other Oath, but let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, leſt ye fall into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and this the Apoſtle commanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things: And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is more than yea, yea, and nay, nay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61899:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>of evil;</hi> but the Pleaders for Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Signs and Shadows, they make light of this great Command, and plead generally for Swearing; and at their very entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Office or Calling, to get their Tythes or Wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they muſt Swear, and ſo break the Commandment of Chriſt at the beginning of their pretended Miniſtry of his Goſpel, in which they Preach up Signs and Ceremonies, for which they can find no ſuch plain nor poſitive Command from Chriſt, or from his Apoſtles; as they may find againſt any Swearing at all: And of what ſucceſs, to the good of any, can their Miniſtry be, the beginning of which is indiſobedience to the ſtrict and poſitive Command of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>And it is evident by many undoubted Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and Records of the Tranſactions of former Times, that true Chriſtians (as well under Apoſtatized Titular Chriſtians, as under Heathens) have deeply ſuffered for their Obedience to Chriſt's Command, in denying to Swear upon any account; and it is alſo evident, that the Preachers up of Signs and Ceremonies, who plead for Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, get more Tythes and Money for their Preaching, than they could get by denying of Swearing; but if (according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles intimation) by Swearing they are fallen, into Condemnation, who can get them out again, though they ſhould give him all their Tythes and Money to get them out?</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61899:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>So it is very plain, that they who pretend by Command from Chriſt to preach up Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Signs, or what they call Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do practice diſobedience to ſeveral of the plain and poſitive Commands of Chriſt; but above all, that weighty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command of Chriſt concerning Faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> (without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God) which Command is this,<note place="margin">John 12.36.</note> 
                  <hi>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light;</hi> this they cannot endure to hear of, they are far ſurely from keeping it; and what a Faith have they, who believe not as Chriſt commandeth to believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now every one that doth evil hateth the light,<note place="margin">John 3.16, to 21.</note> neither cometh to the light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved;</q> and ſo ſuch are far from believing in the light, neither would they have others to believe in it, who hate and ſpeak evil of the light, as the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony-Preachers generally appear to do; but they who have come to the light, and brought their Deeds to the light,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24. Mat. 7.15, to 20.</note> and thro' Faith in it are become Children of light, theſe know Falſe Prophets by their Fruits, and their Signs, as Chriſt foretold; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their own Followers alſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the light of Chriſt in their own Hearts (though but as ſtrangers to it) of much Deceit and Hypocrifie amongſt them; and they that take heed to this light that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reproveth for ſin, and give up their Hearts in the love of it, to anſwer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings of it, to them it will diſcover dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61899:114"/>more and more; but they that reſiſt it, and go from it, the God of this World, (even the Spirit of the Man of Sin, who prevaileth upon ſuch with his Power and Signs) blindeth their Minds, and ſo the Blind leading,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.14.</note> and following the Blind, both fall into the Ditch.</p>
               <p>And if any reckon their Ceremonies, as neceſſary to diſtinguiſh them from others, as <hi>Turks, Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> who do not at all believe, that Chriſt the Meſſiah is come in the Fleſh; yet there is no ground for ſuch an Aſſertion, for they are more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from them who uſe no ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Ordinances, nor Traditional Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations at all; for the <hi>Turks, Mahometans, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> all of them have many ſuch things, though not the ſame, yet as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as any of theirs that profeſs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and they are not like to change their own Ceremonies and Obſervations for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with them, or by the Perſwaſions of them, who can ſhew no better ground for their own, than can be ſhown for ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Infants, and having to them Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and God mothers, ſo called, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And ſo though the aforeſaid Reformers, upon good ground denied the Popes Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Authority, and rejected ſeveral of his Superſtitious Ceremonies, yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was but in part, and the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (though ſome of them anſwered what they knew) yet came not fully to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Practice, and Order of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61899:122"/>Chriſtians, as is plain, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Popiſh Tythes, Oblations, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries, Surplices, Tippets, Hoods, ſquare Caps, and their Bells, Pulpits, Altars, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Fonts, Organs, and Pipes; and alſo they obſerved the Popiſh Lent,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9, 10, 11. 2 Pet. 2. 1 Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3.</note> and other Faſting Days; and they obſerved (like the Papiſts) and called ſome Days, Holy Days, as if others were unholy; and (a cording to the Papiſts) they alſo forbad Marriage in Lent, and at ſeveral other times of the Year; and ſuch things were Propheſied of, to come in the Apoſtacy; but there is o Ground nor Authority for them from Chriſt, nor from the Scriptures of Truth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61899:123"/>being againſt all or many of theſe things, yet could not get thoſe that had been trained up in the abundance of Popiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to come out of them ſuddenly, tho' they might be Convinced of the Folly of them; and they that drew back, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the true Light that had Convinced, were not like to leave them at all: And theſe things are yet retained as Apoſtolical, by many that call themſelves Proteſtants, tho' there was none of them practiſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or Primitive Chriſtians, but were ſince Invented in the Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p>And ſome that took heed diligently to the Light of Chriſt in their Hearts, they came to ſee beyond many things, which in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popery, were kept in practice by pretended Reformers; and ſuch ſeparated from them, upon good ground, and ſo they were called Separatiſts, Fanaticks, Puritans, and by ſeveral other Names: And ſtill whatever they profeſſed, yet they who (not minding the Light of Chriſt in themſelves) were prevailed upon by the Power of the Man of Sin, their Hearts were darkned, and they came not forward out of Superſtition, nor yet to a Settlement in the Truth, as they did who truly followed the Lord in his Light, as he was pleaſed to manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>And ſo there came to be ſo many ſorts of Names given to Profeſſors of Chriſtianity; becauſe when any People being further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of any Superſtitious Practices left
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61899:123"/>them off, and ſeparated from thoſe that uſed them, then preſently there was ſome Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name given unto them; and ſuch as might be Convinced and Separated with them, but not truly minding the Light that Convinced them in their Hearts, they loſt the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Power and Life of Chriſtianity, though they might hold the Form, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and Nick-name: And when others, upon the ſame good ground, ſeparated themſelves from amongſt thoſe Profeſſors, then they ſoon had ſome other Name alſo given unto them.</p>
               <p>And ſo when any ſort of Profeſſors, that were in any kind of Form of Worſhip, how many ſoever they were, without the Life and Power of Godlineſs; thoſe amongſt them that faithfully obeyed the true Light in their Hearts, they could not continue in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with them, but were (in obedience to the Light) conſtrained to ſeparate from them (though they might ſuffer Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it) becauſe they knew that the Lord would not accept of them in that dead for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Worſhip; and ſo they muſt either leave the dead Worſhip of their former Fellow Profeſſors, or elſe they ſhould therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as dead with them again; and ſo be worſe than at the firſt, even twice dead, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>But on the other Hand, thoſe who held the Profeſſion, but (through Diſobedience to the Light in their Hearts) had loſt the Power of Godlineſs; they could turn with

               <p>Yet they that took diligent heed to the Light of Chriſt in their Hearts, and were faithful to anſwer the Requirings of God, thereby made known unto them, they were preſerved conſtant Witneſſes for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, and all the abominable Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Practices thereof, as by the Light they were made ſenſible of the ſame, in that Bloody Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> under which many of them were perſecuted to Death, and Burned, and Killed by the Blood-thirſty Apoſtates that called themſelves Chriſtians, but were Strangers to true Chriſtianity, and to the Life and Power of Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding after the Death of the ſaid Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> then Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> coming to the Crown, and denying the Pope, ſhe was Intituled Supream Head of the Church, and ſhe with her Parliament,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61899:124"/>made an Act for the Uniformity of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with much of the Maſs, all in Engliſh again, and then of above Nine Thouſand Biſhops, Prieſts, Deans, Prebends, Maſters of Colledges, Archdeacons and Abbots that had formerly ſworn to be true to the Pope and Popery, there was not above an Hundred and Twenty that refuſed to take an Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery; ſo it appeareth, that Eight Thouſand, Eight Hundred, and Fourſcore of the ſaid Nine Thouſand, that had lately cauſed to be Burned Hundreds for denying in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign to Bow to Popery, then refuſed not to Swear againſt Popery themſelves, as Hiſtory relateth.</p>
               <p>And in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, many ſuffered deeply for teſtifying againſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Superſtitious Practices and Ceremonies, then by the Biſhops Orders retained and uſed; and for meeting together to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in his Fear, Spirit, and Truth; and they were Impriſoned, and extream hardly uſed, in ſo much that (in their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Parliament) they reckoned the Cruelty of their Perſecutors, to exceed the Cruelty of the Heatheniſh and Popiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Tyrants and Perſecutors, and ſaid, The Records of the Heathen Perſecutions under <hi>Nero, Trajan, Decius, Galienus, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian, &amp;c.</hi> could ſcarcely afford any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the like Cruelty that was uſed to them; they craved but the liberty either to die openly, or live openly in the Land of

               <p>And Six of them were put to Death, Sealing their Teſtimonies with their Blood, whoſe Names follow, <hi>viz. Henry Barrow,</hi> and <hi>John Greenwood,</hi> who were Executed at <hi>Tyburn; John Penry</hi> at <hi>Thomas a Waterings</hi> near <hi>London, William Denis</hi> at <hi>Thetford</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and one <hi>Coppin,</hi> and one <hi>Elias,</hi> at <hi>Edmundsbury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> And it appeareth by Records, that the Chief Inſtruments of their Death was the Clergy, and not the Queen; for one Doctor <hi>Rainolds,</hi> being by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> much preſſed to tell her, what he thought concerning the ſaid <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood,</hi> at laſt told her, <hi>That he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, if they had lived, they would have been Two as worthy Inſtruments for the Church of God, as hath</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>been raiſed up in this Age;</hi> then the Queen ſighed, and ſaid no more: But afterwards being near the place of their Suffering, and calling it to mind, ſhe demanded of the Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi> (who was preſent at their Execution) what an End they made; he anſwered, <hi>A very godly end, and prayed for your Majeſty, and the State:</hi> And there was a Famous Preacher, one <hi>Phillips,</hi> (having ſeen and heard <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>'s Speeches, and Preparation for Death) who ſaid, <hi>Barrow! Barrow! my Soul be with thine!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Deceaſe, in the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, many called Puritans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61899:125"/>greatly, and ſome, for no other Cauſe, but for refuſing to join with the publick Worſhip Eſtabliſhed by the Biſhops, and for ſeparating themſelves from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were Baniſhed the Land of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is obſervable, that the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Year 1644. denying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer Book, and by an Aſſembly of Prieſts, ſetting out a Directory for Publick Worſhip; the generality of the Prieſts then Conformed to that, calling the Common-prayer Book Popiſh Rags of <hi>Rome,</hi> Dregs of the Whores Cup, and the Engliſh Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> was made Protector, he took Courſe in the Year 1653. for the Glergies Recovering their Tythes, and other Dues, as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and many of the People of God, who were led by his Light and Spirit to teſtifie againſt Tythes, and to deny to pay them, becauſe they could not uphold what Chriſt came to pull down, and were alſo made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with the hazarding of their Lives and Eſtates, to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel of Chriſt freely in Sincerity and Truth, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to join with their Man-made Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Worſhip; and telling them plainly, that if they repented not God would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them, as it came to paſs; many ſuch then ſuffered deeply by and under their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, who through Killing and taking Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, were come from a ſuffering ſtate themſelves, into high Places of Earthly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61899:126"/>where being ſetled, they ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their own Sufferings, and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Vows made to the Lord therein, and trod in the Antichriſtian and Popiſh ſteps of Perſecution themſelves, of whoſe Cruelty both <hi>Old England</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> are Witneſſes; but the Lord preſerved his People in Conſtancy and Faithfulneſs to him, in their great and many Sufferings.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all the aforeſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections againſt Popery, and the Common-prayer Book, when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was Reſtored in the Year 1660. and the Common-prayer Book enjoined again, how generally it was received and entertained of the Clergy, is yet freſh in the Memories of many; and how the ſtricteſt ſort of them, in Times of Perſecution, joined with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or crept into Corners, and ran from their Aſſemblies, upon the ſight of Informers, or the like, it is very well known; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, they themſelves, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the true Light, and the Faith that is in it, thought their own Faith not worth ſuffering for, (as really it is not) and ſo they could not abide Perſecution.</p>
               <p>But in Times of Toleration for Liberty of Conſcience, thoſe would numerouſly appear in publick again; though when a Storm of Perſecution aroſe, (as in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second) then few of them durſt appear: But when King <hi>James</hi> the Second began his Reign, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Liberty of Conſcience (which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61899:126"/>to all People) which hitherto conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, and is now by Act of Parliament confirmed; then, and ſince then, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-creepers have bodly appeared in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick again.</p>
               <p>By what is premiſed, it is plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they who were prevailed upon by the power of the Man of Sin, the power of the Devil, and of Darkneſs, to diſobey the Light, the Word of God's Grace and Power in their own Hearts, (whatever they might profeſs of Chriſtianity, yet) they went in the Way of the Man of Sin, and as they perſevered therein, he came to be exalted in them, over all that is called God, and ſo he made them Liars, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Murderers like himſelf, who was a Liar, and a Murderer from the beginning; and ſuch could turn as the Times turned, from one Religion or Profeſſion to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to and fro, any whither, to ſave themſelves, and their worldly things, with which the God of the World hath blinded their Minds, leſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt (who is the Image of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> who is Light) ſhould ſhine in them.</p>
               <p>And alſo it is plain and evident, that they that faithfully obeyed the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, in their own Hearts, they reſiſted the power of the Man of Sin in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and through Faith in the Word of God's Power in their Hearts, were in good meaſure made Conquerors over the power of the Adverſary in their Hearts, and to the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61899:127"/>Honour of God, through the ſame Faith and Obedience of his Light, they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled patiently to undergo what their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Perſecutors, the Members of the Man of Sin, were ſuffered to inflict upon them, which was not only Impriſonment, and loſs of outward Enjoyments and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, but alſo to many Death it ſelf; they would rather part with Goods, and Life, and all, than loſe their Heavenly Treaſure, which God had given into their Earthen Veſſels; the Excellency of which Treaſure and Power is of God; and out of the ſight of all thoſe who diſobey the Light of Chriſt in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>And ſo they in whoſe Hearts God (who commandeth the Light to ſhine out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) hath ſhined, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, who not only by his Light in his Faithful People, revealeth the Man of Sin, but alſo with the Spirit of his Mouth will conſume, and with the Brightneſs of his Coming will deſtroy the Man of Sin, and his Works) theſe having taſted, and experienced ſomething of the Goodneſs of God to their Souls, not only of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo of the Deſtruction of the Man of Sin, and his Works in themſelves, and alſo having ſweet and ſatisfactory Comfort and Conſolation in their Hearts, in the Love of God given unto them, theſe cannot with the Times turn (as Hypocrites do) from one Profeſſion of Religion to another; for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61899:127"/>theſe are fully ſatisfied concerning the Way of God, which is ſtraight, and narrow; and not like the Ways of the Man of Sin, the Devil, the Serpent, which are crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like himſelf, and broad, and wide, and can hold of all ſorts of Profeſſors, and too many go in thereat.</p>
               <p>But theſe, being Children of the God of Truth, who is Light; they love to walk in their Fathers way, which is the true Light, and ſo they cannot, neither dare they go out of it into the Ways of the Man of Sin, and ſo ſerve him again in the leaſt, for they have had too much of his Tyrannical Servitude before, and though his Children love his Ways, wherein they have their pain bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pleaſures, yet the Children of God love them not, but in the fear of God hate them all, and love the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in their Hearts, the Way of God their Father: And ſo it is in vain for Men to offer to force them out of God's Way into their ways; for they dare not, for fear of offending their Heavenly Father, comply in the leaſt, to Worſhip God after any other Way or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but as he manifeſteth himſelf, in the Light of his Spirit of Truth in their Hearts, and Conſciences; in which only, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, he is to be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Neither can they again embrace, or come into the Bondage of Corruptible Elements, Ceremonies, or Traditions of Men,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9. Rom. 8.14, to 22.</note> for which there is no warrant from God their Father, leſt they forfeit their glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <p>And as there is a great difference between the outward husk, ſign, or ſhew of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Followers of the Man of Sin, who are his Children; and the pure, ſpiritual, undefiled Worſhip and Religion of the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, who are Children of God; ſo there is as great a difference between the Nature of the true Chriſtians and falſe, and between the Children of God, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil; and alſo between the Perſecutor for Religion, and the Perſecuted for true Religion; and ſo doubtleſs as great a difference will, and muſt be between their Rewards.</p>
               <p>And ſo every one, Male or Female, Rich or Poor, High or Low, (as they tender the Eternal Salvation of their precious Souls) are to examine themſelves, in and by the true Light of Chriſt Jeſus, which is the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Spirit in their Hearts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>And likewiſe it concerneth all truly to examine themſelves inwardly in the Light of Chriſt, whether they be Baptized truly, with the one Baptiſm of Chriſt by his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Water, and the Fire, and Fan of his Spirit, with which he will, and is able, thorowly to purge his Floor,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.11.12.

               <p>And likewiſe all may examine themſelves, in and by the true Light in their Hearts, whether they be in the true Religion, or not?

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61899:142"/>Chriſt, who are faithful Stewards of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Grace, and diligently improve the Talent which he hath given them, ſhall be a Crown of (never-fading) Glory.</p>
               <p>And they that are faithful to God, tho' it be but as in a little, may be made Stewards or Rulers over more; but they who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, whether in much or little, that is committed to them, and ſin againſt the Light and Grace of Chriſt in their Hearts, and continue in ſo doing, how can ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any other from the Hand of the Lord,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.14, to 31.</note> but the unprofitable Servant's Reward, which is to be caſt into outer Darkneſs, where <hi>ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, will render to every Man and Woman according to their Works, and will bring all People upon the Face of the whole Earth to an account, (not how ſtrictly they have obeyed the Orders, Laws, and Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about Religion, made by Popes, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Biſhops, or Prieſts of any ſort, who ſay, Lo here, or lo there, in this Way, or in that Form, is the true Religion, but) he will have an account how every one hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and profi ed with the Talent which he hath given them to profit withal, which is the Manifeſtation of his Holy Spirit, the true Light inwardly enlightening every Man; and the Word of his Kingdom in their Hearts, the Word of Faith, nigh in the Heart, and in the Mouth, which is the Grace of God that brings Salvation, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61899:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath appeared to all Men; and this Word, Grace, and Light, inwardly reproveth for Sin in the Hearts and Conſciences of People; and woe to them that turn not at its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
               <p>But all that in the love of it receive it, and believe in it, and give up their Hearts and Minds freely to learn of it, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible of the powerful Work of it more and more in their Hearts; for it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that believe in it, and carefully take heed to it, to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts; and to deny all other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men, who are not taught by it, but turn from it, into wantonneſs or worldly-mindedneſs; and it teacheth to deny pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to any Man for his Teachings, whereby he may deceive People; for the Teachings of Chriſt are free, and all Chriſt's Miniſters have freely received, and they freely give, and Covet no Man's Silver,<note place="margin">Acts 20.32, 33, 34.</note> nor Gold, nor Apparel, nor other of his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, but are content with ſuch things as they have; and Godlineſs with Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to them great Gain.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, is the Teacher of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and teacheth them to <hi>live ſoberly,</hi>
